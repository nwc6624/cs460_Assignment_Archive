We love to be back. We'll be back a lot. We're going to win that election. Thank you very much. Hello, Phoenix. It's great being here in the great state of Arizona with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country. Thank you. Thank you. And with your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Arizona in a landslide. It's all over TV that the folks here tonight have helped a great World War II veteran into the arena. I don't know if he knows it, but he's right now the hottest celebrity in the world. I don't know what's going on here. He might even be hotter than Trump right now, I have to say. Did you see the scene? No, he's all over television. Even fake news CNN him on. They say he's a legitimate great hero of World War II. Erwin Julian. Irvin, thank you. And I asked my son Don to get a couple of hats and get some things, and give them to Erwin right now. And I want to thank you. Really, that's a great honor. And thank you for the great job you've done. An American Patriot. Thank you very much. Thank you, Don. How did Don do tonight? Okay? He's good. Good guy. And he loves this country. So this is truly an incredible time for America. We have the best economy, the most prosperous country that we've ever had, and the most powerful military anywhere in the world by far. Do you remember the good time we had a week ago at the State of the Union? You remember that, right? And that was my honor. But I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Our country is stronger today than ever before. And after three years, of very unfair and ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades\\u2026 It was the radical left's pathetic attempts to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow our entire system of government. But guess what? They failed, and our poll numbers are higher today than they've ever been before. And we're standing up to the defense of our Constitution, our freedom and democracy itself. We're doing something that's never been done in the history of our country. This movement has never taken place. Nothing like it ever. And the fake news can attest to it, because if they thought I was saying the wrong thing, it'd be out there immediately. It'd be all over the place. It'd be all over the place. Trump exaggerates. That's terrible what he says. There has never been a movement like this, and it began very early. It began in 2016 with that wonderful, beautiful night. You remember that, right? That beautiful night in November. And we're going to have another beautiful night in November. This time, it's going to be November 3rd. Get ready, November 3rd. We're coming. We're coming. So we're having great polls. You're seeing the polls, except for some of the fake ones. And if I was treated fairly\\u2026 Meaning, if you were treated fairly by the fake news, we'd be up 20 points higher in the polls. There wouldn't even be a competitive election. Unfortunately, it's probably going to be competitive. But I actually think we're going to win by a lot, just like we did last time. But I really believe we'd be up 20 points. I mean, all they do is negative, negative, phony stuff. Russia, Russia, Russia. The impeachment hoax. That's a hoax. But you know, we had great support from the Republican party in the House. It was 197 to nothing. And in the Senate, it was 52 and-a-half to a half. You know what the half was? A halfwit. And while the extreme left has been wasting America's time with the hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. By the way, they turned away 21,000 people outside, so feel very good. Feel very good. We haven't had an empty seat. You know what? We haven't had\\u2026 True. We haven't had an empty seat, and this is a tribute to all of us because this is a movement like nobody's ever seen. But we haven't had an empty seat since your great\\u2026 and this is a great first lady. Came down the escalator with me in Trump Tower a long time ago. We haven't had an empty seat. From our rural communities to our inner cities, we're expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. You saw that, the geniuses. You saw that. You saw that last month. They were doing predictions on one of the shows. What do you think? Well, I think 60,000. What do you think? I think 100,000. What do you think? I think 84,000. These are the ones that tell you all about how to invest. What do you think? And then they came out 225,000, the market goes up again. 225,000. 225,000. So many manufacturing jobs. So many that frankly, we're never going to come back. Remember, you need a magic wand, right? They came back. And remember this, we're paying interest. The past administration didn't pay interest. They pumped money in like it was candy. And we didn't pump money in, we took money out. And not that I was happy about that, because I disagree with it. Because frankly, if we kept the old practice which frankly, some people could dispute one way or the other, we would have been up in my opinion, another 10,000 points in the Dow. And we've set 144 records on the stock market in three years, 144 records. 144 records. Record stock market. And you know what that means? That your 401Ks are up 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. Guys come up to me. He said, \\\"Mr. President, I just want to thank you. My wife used to look at me like I was a total loser, sir. Every year we lost money for years and years. She said what the hell is wrong with you, Henry? And this year sir, I'm up 92%. She loves to me again. She thinks I'm a genius.\\\" 92% 401K. \\\"She thinks I'm a genius, sir. She loves me again.\\\" Shows what money can do, right? But that makes\\u2026 And think of this. Seven million new jobs since we were elected, we were elected. And when I took over, ISIS was all over the place. And we immediately started. We have destroyed 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We have killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi is dead. And we just took out the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. And the fake news doesn't want to tell you that. They don't want to tell you that. They don't want to tell you. In fact, do you remember the dog? Great dog, Conan. When we took out, right? We love Conan. Conan's a tough dog. But when we took out al-Baghdadi, Conan\\u2026 Remember this? Conan got more publicity than President Trump. That's okay. They were looking for al-Baghdadi for 16 years. We found him and we took him out. We killed another one last week. The head of Al-Qaeda. He was gone, dead. And America is respected again, respected like never before. We're respected again. We're no longer the laughingstock that gets taken advantage by every country, including by the way, our allies, who in many cases take a bigger advantage than our enemies. I will tell you that. They take big advantage, but not so much anymore. We're winning. We're winning like never before. Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They hate the fact that we're winning. We're winning big. We're winning, winning, winning. And that is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party in droves. You see it all the time. I just spoke to some of your leaders. He said, \\\"This is unbelievable what's happening. This is unbelievable.\\\" You know, there have never been rallies like that. Sleepy Joe Biden the other day had 68 people. And now they have a new member of the crew, mini Mike. Mini Mike. No boxes, we call him no boxes. And I hear he's getting pounded tonight. You know, he's in a debate. I hear they're pounding him. He spent $500 million so far, and I think he has 15 points. It just came out. Hey fake news, how many points does he have right now, 15? They won't tell you the truth. They won't tell you the truth. MSDNC, MSDNC is worse than CNN. They're owned by a company called Comcast. You can have Comcast, a bunch of phonies. But MSDNC is worse than CNN, and they're all pretty bad. You know, they just came out with a poll. They just came out with a poll a little while ago. Mini Mike was at 15, and crazy Bernie was at 31. That's a lot. And mini Mike just spent $500 million. But the DNC is going to take it away from Bernie again. That's okay, because we don't care who the hell it is. We're going to win. We're going to win. We have to. Well let me tell you, these crooked politicians, they really took away three years from us. Because despite the fact and nobody disputes it, that we've done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything, we've done more than any administration in history. We've done more. But think of it, think of it. We did it with phony witch hunts. We did it with the impeachment hoax over our head the whole time. We did it under circumstances that should never ever happened to another President again. True. But with your energy and enthusiasm this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some of the best, greatest. I love them. Leaders in America, Arizona leaders. I want to start. Come on up here, Governor Doug Ducey. Come on up here, Doug. Come on up here. You're going to speak in a second. Also, I call them warriors because they fought like hell. They worked with our future Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. But we have some of your great warriors. Paul Gosar, come up here, Paul. Come up here. Andy Biggs. Andy Biggs, head of the Freedom Caucus. Andy Biggs. David Schweikert. David, come up here. A big, big star. You know about that, Doug. She became this monster star. She looked with such indignation at the other side, such disgust, Debbie Lesko. He'll be running some day. You said your grandson? Wow. He'll be running someday. Arizona Senate President, you know who that is, right? Karen Fann. Come up, Karen. Arizona House Speaker, Rusty Bowers. Vice President of the Navajo nation, Myron Lizer. And Arizona Republican party State Chair, Kelly Ward. Kelly Ward, come up. And we have a lot of other leaders, but we've got to get back to speaking. Do me a favor before I introduce a very special guest, I'd like to ask your great Governor\\u2026 You know, he won like by 16 points. It wasn't even a contest. You know, I'm very competitive. I want to beat him. Will you please get out to the polls so we can beat him? But he's tough to beat. Doug Ducey, say a couple of words, please. Please. These are great people, great people. Thank you very much. So you know, before I introduce somebody very important to all of us, to me\\u2026 Also, I have to say with us tonight is an Arizona hockey great, a friend of mine. He's a great golfer too. He's a tough golfer. I'll tell you, he's tough to beat. He's tough as hell. And if you beat him in golf, he'll try and beat you physically. He doesn't care. He was the toughest hockey player. He was one of these guys, he could beat you one way and if he couldn't, he just beat them up, right? He'd beat him up. And he's a friend of mine. He's a great guy, Jeremy Roenik. Where's Jeremy? Where is he? Thank you, Jeremy. He's a winner. We're also joined by Donald, Jr. and Kimberly. They're great people, great. And RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. And RNC finance chairman, also happens on a team called the Chicago Cubs, I shouldn't tell you that\\u2026 Todd Ricketts. So finally, it's my great honor to introduce a tremendous person, a great fighter pilot. A lot of people don't know that. She's a great fighter pilot and a warrior Senate. She helped us so much during the impeachment hoax, she didn't wobble one bit, Martha McSally. You know, Martha's tough on the border. And she's working with me to strengthen our military still further, and lower your prescription drug prices. We're making a lot of progress. But her opponent, I have to say this Martha, a guy named Mark Kelly. Even the Democrats don't like him much. He wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, give away free healthcare to illegal immigrants, and he wants to obliterate your second amendment. He wants to get rid of it. The radical liberal Democrats from California and Massachusetts, they're pouring money into Kelly's campaign, because they know that he's a rubber stamp for crying Chuck Schumer, crying Chuck, and nervous Nancy wacko Pelosi. And we're going to have a new Speaker. But that's why Martha has my complete and total support and endorsement, and we have to all get out there and make sure that Martha McSally\\u2026 She's a warrior. Let me tell you, you don't know. We don't know. People don't know, people. This one is tough as hell, and that's what we need. Martha McSally. Thank you. We'll be back. Thank you Martha. Well, she's right. How about that Congressman Al Green? We can't beat him, so we have to impeach him. How about that? That's not what our\\u2026 as they call them, the founders. How many times did you hear the name, the founders? That's not what the founders had in mind. But we're going to have a big, big election victory. We're working to- But we're going to have a big, big election victory. We're working together. I don't think the Republican party has ever been more unified than it is right now. I really don't believe so. So whatever you can do for Martha, we need her. It's been so incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you for everything, Martha. I appreciate it. Thank you. Together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere. We're inclusive. This is the Republican party. We're inclusive. Right here in\\u2026 Right? You know that. Right here in America, right here in Arizona, we've created 240,000 new jobs right here. Including over 60,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs here. Nobody thought it was possible. You've had the best year that you've ever had. Arizona, you've had the best year, the most successful year that you've ever had in the history of the country. It's the best year you've ever had. So I'm going to take all the credit away from your governor. I don't care. No, we have a great team with Doug and everybody else, but you've had the greatest year. You know that, Doug, number one year in the history of your state. It's an incredible achievement. Incredible achievement. I don't know, this has to be pretty good stuff on the debate stage. We'll talk about, \\\"Well, you had the best\\u2026 In many states, the best year they've ever had.\\\" Then they said, \\\"Let's get a new president.\\\" I don't think that's going to work so easily. The country's had the best year it's ever had. Let's get a new president. Let's put in crazy Bernie. Let's go. Crazy Bernie. Unemployment has reached its slowest rate in over 51 years, half a century. The average unemployment rate for my administration\\u2026 Think of this. The average, so we're talking about now more than three years, is the lowest for any US president in recorded history. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, lowest in history. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low in the history of our country. African American and Hispanic American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in 71 years. Soon to be historic. And veterans' unemployment has dropped to a record low. We're working with our veterans, we're taking care of our veterans like nobody's ever taken care of our veterans. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached the lowest level in history. Workers without a high school diploma, you have a lot of them. They left high school. They said, \\\"I should have finished.\\\" They left. They can't go back. They left. We've achieved the lowest unemployment rate without a diploma ever recorded in US history. Isn't that great? They're great numbers. Hispanic Americans right now, more than 500,000 own a home. More than 500,000 more own a home. And we've lifted 10 million people off of the welfare rolls. Think of that. 10 million people have come off of the welfare rolls. And happily. Not that we did anything. They have jobs and they love them. They're making much more money and they love getting up and going for work. If they don't like that job, they can get another one, because people are starving to get great employees right now. They're starving to get great employees. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Median income. Think of this. This is such a big deal. Median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country. Under President Bush, in eight years it went to $450 more. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, under a period of eight years, it went to $975. Under president Donald J. Trump\\u2026 Did you ever hear of him? In only three years, including regulation cuts and tax cuts\\u2026 Because the other ones raise taxes. We cut taxes by the record amount. It went to $10, 000 per family. A record. A record. That's why our consumer right now, our people, they're booming with cash. That's one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better. China had the worst year in the last 67 years. Asia's doing poorly. Europe is doing poorly. The United States is doing great. We're doing the best we've ever done. The best we've ever done. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment, and these are really communities that need it the most, we created Opportunity Zones. We worked with Tim Scott, the great senator from South Carolina. His idea. He came in and saw me. I said, \\\"Let's give it a shot.\\\" Nothing's worked over the years, but this has really worked. Now jobs and investment are now pouring into 168 newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Arizona alone. From Apache to Navajo and Maricopa Counties. We're supporting working families by fighting pay. We are doing a job with paid family leave. We're doing something that nobody's ever done to this extent. Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pocket thanks to the Republican child tax credit. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and cutting through job, killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before. We've ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, and eliminating our reliance on hostile foreign suppliers. For the first time, America is now energy independent. Such beautiful words. Energy independent. We fought wars. We did everything we could. We used to take the straits and everybody else benefited. We'd them clear so that other countries could take oil from the Middle East with\\u2026 That nobody paid us. Now they're starting to pay us a lot of money, folks. They took advantage of us. But we have everything we need right now. We have made such progress in the last three years with pipelines. The Keystone Pipeline, Keystone XL. I approved it. The Dakota Access Pipeline. I approved it. 48,000 jobs. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. The worst trade deals any human being has ever seen. I said, \\\"Who made these deals?\\\" The worst, stupidest deals I've ever seen. They were good for other nations. If you like other nations, that's great. But we're now putting America first. It's very simple. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations, and really, the most corrupt special interests anybody's ever seen. To ship our jobs and our factories to other countries. We lost our taxes, we lost our workers, we lost our companies, and we did nothing about it. Now we've done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA, the worst deal ever made, worst trade deal ever made, and one that was almost as bad and gave China an entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the World Trade, WTO. One of the worst deals that we participated in this. By the way, we just won $7.5 billion in a lawsuit with WTO. We weren't winning anything. We weren't winning anything, but they said, \\\"I think this guy's going to pull out.\\\" They treated us so unfairly. We were always in the minority position. I mean, who the hell negotiated these deals? But they look at us and they say, \\\"Look, if we're not treated fairly, we're gone.\\\" All of a sudden, we're winning all these cases. But we just won 7.5 billion. 7.5 billion. Did you know that, Doug? 7.5 billion. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America's no longer for sale. America is no longer for sale. Those days are over. Two generations of politicians came and went promising to replace NAFTA. How many times have you heard we're going to replace NAFTA? Probably the number one reason I ran for office. Are we glad I ran for office? I think so. It's funny, I was watching the different\\u2026 I find it fascinating. I'm watching the different returns coming in and I'm watching as much as I can of this stuff. I love it. We all love it. If you don't love it, you're not going to do it very well. The crazy New York Times, which was a dead newspaper when I ran, it was dead as a doornail. A month before I ran, Doug, I held up a New York Times, it was like what you get thrown in your face at a supermarket. It was a thing. It just flew away. There was nothing. Now it's doing very well. But you know what? Someday we won't be here. When we're not, those papers are in big trouble. But this thing was a dead newspaper. But I was watching and they had an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how they're doing. They have Mini Mike has spent $411 million. It's a question mark, how's he going to\\u2026 I'll tell you how he's going to do. He's probably not going to get the democratic nomination. That's how he's going to do. But Mini Mike, $411. Then they had this idiot, Steyer. We call him impeachment Steyer. How did that work out, Steyer? He's another beauty. The guy worked\\u2026 He spent 210 million. He got one-third of 1% in Iowa. In New Hampshire he did much better. He got less than 3%. Guy's in there for like 250 million. How did it work out, Steyer? You jerk. I never even heard of him. I never even heard of him. I turn on every time\\u2026 For years, I'm turning on\\u2026 Impeach him. They don't even know why. They never say why. They don't have any reason. Impeach the president. This guy spent a fortune on this stuff, so it worked out pretty good. But anyway, so then I go and I look. It has Mini Mike's\\u2026 Question marks. I can give you the answer, but right now they have to have a question mark, right? Then they go down and they had other people. Some of them I like. They have Ross Perot, who honestly\\u2026 It was a tough day for Bush when he joined the campaign. Because Clinton didn't win. Ross Perot took away 19% of the votes. Didn't Clinton get 41 or 43%? Give me a break. But that's okay. Whatever. But they had Ross Perot spent like 100 million, which is probably double if you bring it up to today's dollars. Then they have different people. A friend of mine who ran, Steve Forbes, he ran twice. He was in for a lot. Then they had Donald Trump. Now, this is your own money. This is your own money. I said I'd spend a lot of money on my primaries. We'll see how the hell we do. It's amazing. Once you win, money comes in. It comes in pretty fast. What's that all about? But so in the middle they had Trump, and then they had four or five that were behind me. Lot of money spent. Loss, loss, loss, loss, loss. But in the middle they have Donald Trump. It didn't say 500 million, and it didn't say 250 like this Steyer guy. It didn't say\\u2026 It said 70 million of my own money. I spent 70. It said, \\\"Donald Trump won the presidency of the United States.\\\" Right? We won. My father would teach me, if you could spend less and win, that's better than spending a lot and winning. Crooked Hillary spent at least three times more than we did and lost. Crooked as hell. She's crooked as hell. We have a double-sided justice. It's very unfair what's going on. Very unfair. But let's see how it all works out, folks. Let's see how it all works out. I hope you're going to be happy. I hope you're going to be happy, because there are a lot of dishonest slimeballs out there. Dishonest scum. Dirty cops, a lot of dirty cops. By the way, the FBI, those guys in that are incredible. But the ones on top, they were absolute scum. What they were trying to do, if that happened to Obama, or a Democrat, or especially a liberal Democrat, they'd be in jail for 50 years and it would have taken place two years ago already. They spied on our campaign. Remember that. After they spied, we won. Then after we won, they tried to get us out of office. It's never happened before in the history of our country, and we can't let that happen. We can never ever excuse it. We can never let them get away with that. Never let them get away with it. But we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great. The last month, we ended the NAFTA\\u2026 Look, you saw it. NAFTA catastrophe. That's what it was. We ended that catastrophe. Again, I really ran because of NAFTA. I said, \\\"How stupid.\\\" All over the place. In your state, but you go to New England, empty factories, empty buildings. Still you have empty buildings. We lost so much. We lost 60,000 factories and plants. I signed that brand new, beautiful US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, and ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Arizona. By the way, for people with the small farms and small businesses, if you love your children, you can now leave your companies, you can leave your farm, you can leave your ranch to your children, and you don't have to to pay, they don't pay a death tax. They don't pay an inheritance tax. A big deal. That's a big deal. So if you love your children, it's good. If you don't love your children, it doesn't matter. Don't leave it to them, if you don't love. If your children are no good to you, don't give them anything. Let them go out and work like hell. No, if you love\\u2026 Does anybody in this incredible audience\\u2026 Man, this is a big building. Does anybody not love their children? Anybody? Do I have a hand? Do I have a\\u2026 There's a hand. You've got to be kidding. You've got to be kidding. So then you don't care about the tax. Okay, don't worry about it. He says, \\\"No, I don't care about that one.\\\" Well, that's good. You look like a nice guy too. He's tough. You'd love to be his kid, wouldn't you? But I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports. China will invest $250 billion a year into the United States and buy our products and create jobs. Nothing like that has ever happened before. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. That's the way we want it. We are finally putting our country first. We are putting America first. On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than immigration. You know it almost better than anybody. Anybody, Doug. You know it better than anybody, what they've done on your border, but we're stopping that border. That border is clogged, and we've started the big wall right in Arizona. We build a lot of wall. That's a big one. That's a big one. Top of the line. Before I came into office, the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children. Including, as you know very well right here in Arizona, Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border. Then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, healthcare, everything. They want to give them everything. For a long period of time, they were treated\\u2026 You know this before I came. They were treated far better than our veterans were treated. Now our veterans are treated great. True. Illegal immigration costs Arizona taxpayers more than $2 billion every year. Two billion you're paying. Nearly 20% of Arizona's annual budget in general funds goes toward this big problem. For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild our cities all throughout America, which is what we should be doing. Under my administration, we are finally taking care of our own citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities. Every day, Democrats' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives. In Arizona alone last year, ICE officers arrested over 4,500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. Right here in Phoenix, an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he laid dying in the street. This savage animal had previously been deported after serving six years in prison. He was in prison six years. He was there six years and nobody wants to talk about it. They want to protect them. Last year in Tucson, another illegal alien was sentenced to 10 years for repeatedly raping a vulnerable young woman. Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals, and they support deadly sanctuary cities that release these criminal aliens directly into America's communities. Thankfully, Arizona has banned sanctuary cities. With a Republican majority in Congress, we will ban them in every state in America. 30 in the morning. I then went to California, made two speeches. I then went someplace else. I said, \\\"Am I finished?\\\" No, you've got to go to Arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25,000 people. I said, \\\"That's okay. That's okay.\\\" I said, \\\"That's okay.\\\" No, I said, \\\"That's okay,\\\" because I love this unbelievable energy in this crowd. But you know what? Honestly, there's tremendous energy in our nation. There's tremendous energy in our nation. Greatest nation in the world. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row, which will soon be a record. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring. The month of January saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years. And we've ended catch and release, a horrible Democrat policy that we got terminated. Border patrol, great people, have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year. We've deported record numbers of gang members, including the worst gang of all, MS-13. Thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in history. We're building the wall, as I said, faster than ever. It will soon be almost one new mile a day. We're looking for that. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme, taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders. How's he doing tonight? 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover of the world. Think of this, 180 million Americans are going to lose healthcare coverage under this plan. But if you don't mind, I'm not going to criticize it tonight. Let them keep going and I'll start talking about it about two weeks out from the election. Okay? Because I don't want him to change. Please don't change. Same with the Green New Deal. I don't want to talk about it, Doug, tonight. I don't want to talk about it. I came up with the name Pocahontas. Too early. But fortunately, she's self-destructed anyway. Did you ever see a phony like that? She's a phony. She lost because she couldn't keep it straight on her own heritage. She said she was an Indian. I said, \\\" I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none.\\\" She said, \\\"Oh,\\\" and she panicked. She panicked, and she had a test. You know the result, 1/124th. I think I win the bet. Somewhere along the line, I think I win. No, she\\u2026 I did it too early. I would have saved it, but I guess it was effective. She's essentially gone-zo, so\\u2026 One of those things. While the socialist Democrats are try- \\u2026 one of those things. While the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your social security, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. And that's what we're getting. That's right. One of the big secrets. The Democrats won't let us say it. They want to keep that as quiet as possible. Look what they gave you, the worst healthcare. And what we've done, we've gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you. Everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice. We're making healthcare better and much, much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office, we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive than they were, and it's better healthcare. A lot of people don't know this. People don't know this. They think that's their issue. It's not. They failed on healthcare. We're protecting people with preexisting conditions, and we always will. And by the way, we're trying to get rid of Obamacare, but we're managing it incredibly, but we're trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions. Remember that. We're trying to get rid of it, but while we're having it, we're managing it really much better than they did. Remember they built the $5 billion website? Remember that? It was supposed to cost $5 million. It cost $5 billion. $5 billion. I mean, you could get a kid out of high school. I have a son. He's a young boy, 13. He uses a computer. He could have given them a healthcare site. I would say he would have charged them $100, Barron Trump, and it would've worked. He's so good. \\\"Hi dad. How you doing, dad? How's it going?\\\" Bing, bing, bong. I said, \\\"Don't play with that while you're talking to me.\\\" \\\"What's going on, dad?\\\" These kids are incredible, right? The kids, they make us look like babies with that. But he could have given you a great site for about $2. They spent $5 billion on a site that never worked. By the way, speaking of that, how did they do with their vote count in Iowa? And I hear, I hear, I don't want to say it. I don't want to jinx them because, of course, I want them to do well, but I do. We don't have anything. Nobody's running against us in so many states. It's sort of nice. We can save the thunder, right? But I hear that in Nevada. I'm hearing bad things about their vote count. I hear a lot of bad things are happening, like they don't know what the hell they're doing. I turned on the other night, Iowa, I wanted to see \\u2026 And by the way, we set a record in the history of Iowa. We had more votes than anybody's ever had as an incumbent president. Same thing in New Hampshire. It's a good sign. It's a good sign. By a lot. By the way, by a lot. But I'm hearing that, and I hope this isn't the case because I'd like to find out who the hell won. We still don't know who won in Iowa. I heard coming over here they're still working on the count. No, no, no. He said, \\\"You won.\\\" Yeah, I think we did win. I think we did. Very good. That's very good. I have to thank you, that one. That's very good. No, we did win. Look, we are winning. We're winning big. We have fake polls out there. These guys do fake polls. They are fake polls. I had a poll. It's just like it was in 2016. I'd hear these polls. I'd hear women didn't like me, and I did great with women. I hear everyone didn't like me. Nobody liked me. Nobody liked me. And then we won. Thank you, women. Nobody liked me 2016. No, no, I hear that. Remember, women didn't like him, and at the end of that he did great with women. He did great with this. He did great with everybody. We did great with everybody. Remember, 306 to 223. That's a slaughter. That's a slaughter. Remember, they said he cannot get, they used the word path. There is no path, right, to 270? I was at 269 if I did great, but they said there's no chance. But I was at 269, so I went to Maine. I love Maine. I went to Maine. Maine's cut in half. And one Maine has one. I went there four or five times. People are great. I won it. And they were right. There is no path to 270, but there was a path to 306. These people. These people. There is no path. That's right, Doug. They said there is no path, the fake news media. \\\"There is no path for Donald Trump.\\\" And then they said the evening of the election, \\\"It's going to be a really short night for Donald Trump. Thank God, we got rid of this guy.\\\" Because they did the exit polls going out, right? And I was even told, but a lot of people didn't want to talk about it. The highest number in history of people that said very nasty language, but I'm not going to use that name because you'll kill me if I use it. So I won't use it. It's a much better story if I use it because that's the truth. That's what they said. \\\"How did you vote?\\\" Usually, they say, \\\"I voted for Clinton,\\\" or, \\\"I voted for Trump.\\\" Right? \\\"How'd you vote?\\\" \\\"None of your business.\\\" See, I'm being nice, right? I'll keep it that way because otherwise we'll ruin the whole evening. They'll say, \\\"His language,\\\" right? Even this tough guy in the front says, \\\"I agree.\\\" \\\"How did you vote?\\\" \\\"No, I don't want to tell you.\\\" \\\"How did you vote?\\\" \\\"None of your damn business. I'm not going to tell you.\\\" \\\"How did you vote?\\\" \\\"I'm not \\u2026 \\\" And it was like this massive number, right? Massive. So everybody, they just didn't count that. So they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked Hillary Clinton. They're looking unbelievable. This is going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump. We finally will be rid of this guy. And then the numbers started coming in. The numbers started coming in, and it started with the great state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. And then that beautiful convention center, the most beautiful stage I've ever seen. And they knew something was going on because they didn't pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before. Right? In fact, I went to the fireworks company, and I said, \\\"I'll give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks,\\\" even though they were no way near where my area was. We were at a hotel in Midtown. We liked the location better than where she chose, but they built the most \\u2026 we remember that beautiful stage. It was shaped like the United States of America. And by the end, it didn't look too good. Did you ever see more unhappy people? So they go, \\\"Donald Trump has won the great state of Florida. They go, \\\"Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\\" They outspent me like five to one. Only negative ads. They're all negative. So by the time people got into the voters booth, they only knew one thing. She hated Donald Trump, but they said, \\\"What the hell does she stand for? What does she do?\\\" Every ad was a negative ad. So it tells you negative ads, at least against me, aren't so good. They can be effective. But I think they spent like $ 2 billion on negative ads. Everything was negative. So nobody knew what the hell she spent. You know, her husband said she was going to lose. Her husband's a professional. Her husband said, \\\"You better go to Michigan because I was there and they got a Trump/Pence sign on every lawn I've ever seen. You better go to Wisconsin, Hillary. You better go to Wisconsin.\\\" She said, \\\"No, we haven't lost Wisconsin in 36 years\\\". \\\"No, no, Hillary, you got to go there. I'm telling you, I don't like what I saw.\\\" \\\"No, what do you know?\\\" He's a professional politician. She wasn't. It's one of those little problems in life. So then it came in, and then we won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. Right? And we were leading Pennsylvania by so much that if I lost, remember at 2% of the vote left, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot. They refused, the fake news refused to call it. I kept saying, \\\"We won Pennsylvania. Why don't they call it?\\\" It was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake, they're crooked. They are fake. And I said, \\\"Why don't they call Pennsylvania?\\\" But some beautiful things happened. And by the way, Ohio, we won by one of the largest margins ever. The great, great, great state of Ohio. Remember? Remember, they used to say a year before the election, they said, \\\"Well, nobody can win. Nobody, unless you win the great state of Ohio.\\\" And we won the great state of Ohio, and we won it big. We knew we were going to win it. And now we're up a lot more than we were up even then, because you know why? We're bringing back jobs. We're bringing back factories. Everybody's working. Nobody's ever had a better year than we've been having. And we've been doing it for a long time, right? Almost from the beginning. And don't let them try and take credit, because if they came in, we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse, the D word, depression. We would have been, because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on. And I'll tell you, maybe bigger than even the tax cuts, and I did it sooner, were the regulation cuts. We freed up our nation to go back to work. True. So then we won Wisconsin, and then we won Michigan because those companies, now they're pouring back in. The auto companies are pouring back in, and Wisconsin's doing great with the farmers that Canada was taking. You know, Canada was charging our farmers 287% tariffs for dairy products. Okay? So what happens is this, we're working on healthcare. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. We've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the brand drugs, but they cost a tiny fraction. We've totally transformed veteran's healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they said could not be done. And we passed the spectacular right to try. So if you're in trouble, and I hope nobody in this massive arena's in trouble, but if you're in trouble, you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors, best hospital, best labs. You get it. And the luck we are having, we are saving so many lives. It's incredible what's happening. People would go to Europe. They'd go to Asia. If they had no money, they'd go home and die. Now they have the right to use our drugs before they're approved. Think of that. Before they're approved. And we're very importantly combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths. The overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 34 years, and life expectancy is rising again in our nation. We've launched bold new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer's disease. We're making tremendous progress, and we're pursuing new advances in neo-medical research. Think of that, neonatal research, the numbers are incredible. What's happened is incredible, to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in doing so. All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why in my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We have tremendous energy. Tremendous energy. Everybody says to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" Because I love what we're doing. I see the results, and they're happening faster than you even think. You see the numbers. They're happening faster than you would even think. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We are the party with big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right? Right? To keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life. There's been nothing like this. I passed criminal justice reform, not the Democrats. I did it with the Republicans, and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the Republican party. The Democrats did not do it. They could never have done it.  Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. We have invested $2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including nearly $200 million for Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. Right? I recognized Israel as the true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. We recognize Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They've been trying to get it for 52 years. And for years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You saw that. They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Arizona. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. It is. This election is so important. It's the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020. You're the forgotten people no more. Right? No deplorables, right? No deplorables. Who knew that was going to turn out to be such a disaster? But you know, she used the worst word. What was the word she used? Irredeemables, right? I thought that was the problem. No, it was deplorable. So what the hell do I know about politics? She said, \\\"You're irredeemable and deplorable.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that irredeemable's terrible.\\\" The next day people are showing up. Women, \\\"I'm a deplorable.\\\" Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp, which is vicious, horrible, ugly, and evil. Much worse than I thought. But we're getting there and not pleasant. A bunch of really bad people, very dishonest people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words and phrase. I love the phrase, Made in the USA. Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within now nine years. We started a year ago. Can you imagine that? We're doing that, and it's going to happen. Who would have thought we could have done that? We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, and you know this. You know it's under siege, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will defend it. It's under siege. It's under siege. You see it in Virginia. They want to take away the guns. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto In God We Trust. From Tucson to Tombstone, right? Do you agree? You agree, right? Look at him. He's agreeing, this guy. He's agreeing. No more censorship is right. No more evil. No more crimes. You're right. From Yuma to Mesa and from Flagstaff to right here in Phoenix, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom. Arizona was founded by pioneers and prospectors, great prospectors, cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, braved the blazing sun, and it is hot here. I've been here during the summer. I want to tell you, it's seriously hot. Of course, didn't they say that President Clinton, when he went on the back of the plane was here to play golf, it was 121 degrees that day? I don't know about that. I don't know about that. What do you think he was doing with the Attorney General? I remember he said, \\\"Oh, I just happened to see she was \\u2026 I was here to play golf. It was 120 degrees out.\\\" I don't know. A lot of crooked stuff went on. I wonder what they talked about. I'm sure it wasn't that she would become a Supreme Court Justice. I'm sure it wasn't that they were going to extend her tenure as Attorney General. She was a real beauty. I'm sure it wasn't. I'm sure it was nothing. They spent 45 minutes on the plane talking about golf and their grandchildren. Right? Can't let it happen, folks. Can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. You fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are making it greater every single day than ever before. Great, great, great citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and with your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Do you like winning? Because not very long ago you weren't winning, and I don't want you \\u2026 I told this a few times during the campaign. Haven't used it in a long time, but I don't want you going to your great governor. He's a great governor, Doug Ducey. I don't want you going to your governor saying, \\\"Governor, governor, we just can't stand winning so much. Please go see the president in the oval office. Governor, the people of Arizona don't want to keep on winning. It's too much governor. It's not even fair to the rest of the planet. Please tell him, Governor Ducey, please tell him, \\u2018President, the people of Arizona have won too much. We don't want to keep on winning.'\\\" And I'll look at Doug Ducey, and I'll say, \\\"Doug, I've a lot of respect for you, Doug. You won by 16 points. That means a lot. But Doug, I don't care what you say. We're going to keep on winning, and we're going to win like never before. And the people of Arizona are going to love it.\\\" And he's going to say, \\\"Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going back home.\\\" The fact is, we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Arizona, the best is yet to come. That's right. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Arizona. Thank you. \",\n          \" Well, thank you to Vice President Pence. Thank you, Mike. And hello Pennsylvania. Hello. It's great to be back in this state that gave us the Liberty Bell, Pennsylvania Steel, Hershey chocolate. I like Hershey chocolate. The Nittany Lions. The Nittany Lions, they're doing pretty well too and the incredible American Patriots just like you, you are Patriots. Thank you very much. Thank you. Under Republican leadership, America is stronger than ever before and we are respected again. Last month you saw it, we smashed expectations with another 266,000 jobs and unemployment is now more than a 50-year low. We have never seen what's going on with different groups. Unemployment is at a position we've never had anything like this. You are so lucky I became your president. I'm only kidding. I have to say I'm kidding because the fake news back there will take that. They'll take that statement and they'll blow it up and they'll say, \\\"He said they were lucky to have him as president. What a horrible thing to say.\\\" Because they're fake. Anyway, here in Pennsylvania you had the single best year that you've ever had in the history of our country, not bad. The Pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all time record low. And I hate to tell you this, when I was campaigning three and a half years ago, I'd come here, you weren't doing so well, folks. You weren't doing so well. Wages were way down, unemployment was way up. It wasn't a pretty picture. Just a few months ago, I visited the new Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County at $6 billion with a B, $6 billion. It is the largest investment in Pennsylvania history. We're ending decades of failed trade policies that devastated communities all across the state. For generations, American manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy, the bedrock. Remember the last administration, \\\" You need a magic wand. It'll never come back.\\\" We found the magic wand, didn't we? Then came NAFTA, the NAFTA disaster, I call it, one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs. Your politicians always pledged to fix it. They'd talk about it for years and years and decades, but they never were able to do it. They came and they went to Washington and they did nothing. But unlike those politicians, I keep my promises. And I love Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania, you know that right? I know it well. And I'm thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the NAFTA catastrophe once and for all. Congress will soon vote on my new trade deal, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement or USMCA. After years of waiting, many, many years, many, many decades, they've been looking for this, and then we got it done and we've been waiting for a long time for Nancy Pelosi to announce USMCA and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the United States and your favorite president, I think. And the reason they announced it on the same day, one hour later, they announce impeachment, a few guys standing behind her. They announced the impeachment, and then an hour later, she announced that she's going to USMCA. You know why? It's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment, and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment. And think of it this way also, the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt, that's the reason they approved USMCA. So that's okay with me, because they approved it and they're very happy to have it. But honestly, it's an incredible deal for our country. Took too long, it waited in Congress for too long a time. Incredible deal, and replacing the worst, NAFTA. We've also just reached a deal with Congress to invest a record $738 billion more into our great military. When I took over, I will tell you, I became president\\u2026 Think of it, almost three years ago. By the way, was that the most exciting night ever? I'm just watching these people, that was one of the greatest evenings in the history of television from a rating standpoint, from an excitement standpoint, what the hell would they do without me and you? They'd be gone. About a month before I ran, I picked up a New York Times, it was like a leaflet that you had out at a grocery store and now it's thick. They've got all their reporters covering Trump, Trump, Trump. I can't imagine they won't endorse because without me winning, you know what happens? They all go down the tombs they got, all of them, Washington Post, New York Times, those very dishonest networks. They are very dishonest, very, very dishones. No, they're very dishonest people. And I have to say this, look, and I always have to say this, you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications, but not too many of them, I have to be honest with you. Well, you know that. Does anybody think the media is honest? Does anybody think they're totally corrupted and dishonest? All right. The legislation will also officially establish something that's so important to me because it's where it's at. And a lot of people used to smile and now outside of the wall, which we're building\\u2026 The wall is going on. It gets one of the biggest applause of anything, it's the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force. We're opening up the Space Force because you know what, that's where it's at. And everything's built right here in the United States. That's simple. And by the way, we build the greatest weapons, the greatest planes, the greatest ships, we build it in the United States, there's nobody that comes close. We have the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world, rockets and missiles, no place builds it like us. We have the best in the world and we sell it to allies and they all want to buy from the United States. We've never had a thing like this. We are so hot. We are so hot. And just a few weeks ago, the United States Special Forces brought the world's number one terrorist to justice. Thanks to the strength and courage of our warriors, and they're great warriors, the bloodthirsty savage known as Al Baghdadi is now dead. And he was quickly replaced by his second-in-command and his second-in-command is now dead. And we've got our eye on and our sights on third also, we know exactly where and when, but it's becoming a very unpopular job, not a lot of takers and that's what we want. Go back to living a good normal life because America is winning again. America is winning again like never before. And as I always say, and I've already said it twice tonight, this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago, we were laughed at. But while we're delivering historic victories for the American people, the radical left Democrats and the failed Washington establishment are trying to erase your votes, nullify the election and overthrow our democracy. Not going to happen, don't worry about it. I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it. And I have to say this about the Republicans, the Republicans\\u2026 And you have a lot of great ones here tonight, your Congressman. You have a lot of great ones, these congressmen are great. The Republicans have never been so United as they are right now, ever. The House, the Senate, we've never been this United because it's all a hoax and they understand it. They also understand poll numbers, but I'm sure that had nothing to do with it. But the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote, or in the alternative, trying to win the 2020 election. That's not going to happen. Yesterday, the Justice Department's Inspector General released a report detailing the outrageous, scandalous and unprecedented abuses of power. Get them out. Get her out. Get her out. Get her out. See, these guys want to be so politically correct, you get her out. You see that? I'll tell you, law enforcement is so great. That particular guy wanted to be so politically correct. We don't want to be politically correct. I don't know who he was, he didn't do the greatest job, so they tried to frame innocent people in the ludicrous\\u2026 It all started with the Russia witch hunt. Then the inspector general shocking report proved that the Obama FBI obtained secret warrants to spy on my campaign based on a phony foreign dossier of debunk smears, paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. The FBI failed to disclose the nature of the political hit job to the Pfizer court. They hid it, they deceived it, and they lied. The dossier was written by a discredited foreign agent who quote, \\\"Desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the United States president.\\\" What's this? Folks, they spied on our campaign, they spied. Never happened before in the history of our country and we're really wise to it. We're wise to it. The inspector general found that the FBI spying application contained 17 errors and omissions, commonly known as lies and deceit. When the FBI\\u2026 And you have great people in the FBI, but not in leadership. You have not good people in leadership, you haven't had. When the FBI uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong, which was right at the beginning, they hid that exonerating, you know that? They hid it. They hid it so nobody could see it, so they could keep this hoax going on for two years. They knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up, a set up, but they hid it so that nobody could see it, so they could keep it going on, thinking they were going to hurt us politically. But now we're stronger politically than we were ever before. And the FBI also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign. Look how they've hurt people. They've destroyed the lives of people that were great people, that are still great people. Their lives have been destroyed by scum, by scum. An FBI lawyer forged, took an email\\u2026 forged, forged an email used as evidence, an act which is now the subject of a criminal referral. What they did is so unbelievable. Oh, I look forward\\u2026 I don't know. I don't know, keep away. I look forward to Bull Durham's report, that's the one I look forward to. And this report was great by the IG, especially since he was appointed by President Barack Hussein Obama. Considering that fact, it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out variously, although I suspect we would have. We also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high ranking officials were consumed with anti- Trump and anti-Trump people hatred and bias, texting about an insurance policy, let's have an insurance\\u2026 remember? Remember? Peter Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page. Remember? \\\"Lisa, I love you so much. Lisa, please, Lisa please. Lisa, I've never loved anyone like you. We won't allow this to happen to our country. Lisa, please tell me you love me. Lisa, I love you.\\\" \\\"Peter, I love you. I love you like I've never loved anyone. And if for any reason she loses, even though she's a stone called corrupt person, if for any reason she loses, Peter, we've got to have an insurance policy, we have to do it because we're going to go\\u2026 \\\" And that's what's been happening for the last two and a half years. It was their phony insurance policy. So FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, so in love that she didn't know what the hell was happening texted the head of Counter Intelligence, Peter Strzok, likewise so in love he couldn't see straight. This poor guy, did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing to keep him away from Lisa? That's what I heard. I don't know if it's true. The fake news will never report it, but it could be true. No, that's what I heard. I don't know. I mean who could believe a thing like that? No, I heard that Peter Strzok needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover. Ah, Lisa, I hope you're miss him. Lisa, he'll never be the same. But he said he's not ever going to become president and Strzok look back, \\\"No, no, he won't. We'll stop it. We'll stop it.\\\" Can you believe we found these texts? This is FBI agents at a high level. \\\"No, no. We'll stop it.\\\" They're going to stop us from winning an election and then we have to listen, \\\"There was no bias. Oh, there was no bias.\\\" Think of these people, they write here was no bias. And yet he saying, \\\"No, no, darling, we'll stop it.\\\" And then they announce there was no bias. Now you know what we're doing, and it's not easy, and somebody said a regular president\\u2026 I don't want to use the word normal because that's not a nice normal refer\\u2026 A regular president would have been under a table, thumb in the mouth saying, \\\"Take me home mommy, this is too tough for me.\\\" It's true. True, they know. And while it was tough on my family, I have to say, very unfair to my family, very tough on my family. I have a great family, tough\\u2026 For me, it's my life. I do it, I do it. It's one thing, but very tough on a family thing, a thing like this happens, it's a disgrace. But day after day we're exposing something called that filthy, disgusting, horrible swamp and we're cleaning it up. And now after and a half years now that the Russia witch hunt is dead, a big fat disgusting fraud, the Congressional Democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with Ukraine, but that's already failing. You saw their so-called articles of impeachment today, people are saying they're not even a crime. What happened? All of these horrible things, remember? Bribery and this and that. Where are they? They send these two things and not even a crime. This is the lightest, weakest impeachment\\u2026. Our country has had actually many impeachments, you recall judges and lots of\\u2026 many impeachments, but it was on today, everybody said, \\\"This is impeachment light.\\\" This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far. It's not even like an impeachment. These people are stone cold crooked. When a guy like shifty Schiff, he's a corrupt politician, he made up my statement because\\u2026 See, I did one thing very good, as soon as I heard about this deal, I released my statement immediately, but he had already made horrible statements. And by the way, the whistleblower, the whistleblower defrauded our country because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game. Remember the second whistleblower was coming, right? And then the informer, who is the informer? I know who the informer is. So the informer obviously gave him a false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report, they wrote something totally different from what I said, what I said was perfect. But it screwed up the whole works because most guys would never do that. They didn't even know probably that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word for word transcribed, so beautiful. Am I lucky I had it transcribed? Think of that. Think of that. So when I said release it\\u2026 And I don't like doing that because you're releasing it, it's a conversation with a foreign leader, in this case, a very fine gentlemen, president of Ukraine, the new president of Ukraine. And we call them up and we said, \\\"Would it be okay?\\\" Our secretary of state made the call, \\\"Would it be okay?\\\" And they didn't know what we were talking about, but they said, \\\"Yeah, it's okay.\\\" And by the way, he, his foreign minister, everybody did you know they said, \\\"There was no pressure. He didn't do anything wrong. There was no pressure put on us.\\\" That didn't stop anybody but we released the conversation and that gummed it up. Now, all of a sudden we never heard from the second whistleblower. We never heard about who the informer was. The whistleblower who's going to come out strong, he's disappeared. Where's the whistleblower? He's disappeared. He's gone. Maybe our great Congressman can find him. He's gone. Maybe our great Congressmen can find him. Okay? But the whistleblower is gone. He flew the coop because he reported incorrectly, and the IG, who didn't want to look at the conversation, he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to Congress so that Congress could have fun with it, ought to be ashamed of himself. But today, the House Democrats announced these two flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous articles of impeachment. The House Democrats are walking back from everything they claimed. With today's announcement, they're now admitting there was no collusion, there was no obstruction of justice, and there were no crimes whatsoever. There are no crimes. It says that, there are no crimes. They're impeaching me and there are no crimes. This has to be a first in history. They're impeaching me. You know why? Because they want to win an election. And that's the only way they can do it. So the Democrats have nothing, and they've turned the somber process of impeachment. And it was, you know, to me, impeachment is a very ugly word. It's a word I associate with some very bad times in our country. The good news is we're having the best times in history in our country. Okay? But the word impeachment, to me, is a very, very ugly word. It's a dark, ugly word. But, but I have to tell you, as bad as it is, it meant something. When you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors, when you had serious, go ahead, it's impeachment. That would happen every 50 years, every 40 years, every 100 years. This was a big deal. They're making it so like, \\\"Let's do it every six months.\\\" They've cheapened a process. They've cheapened a process. These people are so bad, the radical left Democrats, and I actually think that Pelosi, who by the way, by the way, by the way, she has totally lost control. She has totally \\u2026 It's being run now by this crazy AOC plus three. AOC plus three. Now it's being run by other people. The far left has just grabbed that party. It is so sad to see. And she knew what would happen. I didn't, because I didn't figure the polls would go through the roof. They went out today. In Michigan, in Wisconsin, in a place called Pennsylvania. No, no. The polls are through the roof. They're called swing states, very important states. We won Pennsylvania the last time, and we're going to win it again, but even bigger. Our polls have gone, over the last month, they've gone through the roof. You look at it, take a look at it, it came out today. The FireHouse poll, it's an important poll. It was always good. I never looked at it. Today, I like it a lot. We're up through \\u2026 nobody can even believe it. So what Pelosi did, and as I said, they do the impeachment, then right away, let's do USMCA, right on top of it. You'd think she'd wait like a day. She wanted to smother the impeachment crap, and that's probably what she did, at least to an extent. But any Democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority, their dignity, and their career. Okay? And some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time, think of this. How about Low IQ Maxine Waters? How about Green? How about Green? We've Green. How about Green, where he said, \\\"We have to impeach him because if we don't impeach him we're not going to win the election.\\\" This is what we're dealing with. You know, we're dealing with some very bad people. We're dealing with people that don't respect you. And by the way, you know they talk about the elite? You're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. You're the elite. You got better education. You got better everything. You're the elite. It always bothers me, they said, \\\"The elite.\\\" This is the elite. Look at these people. How beautiful. This is the elite. You know who are the elite? You look at those jobs reports. We're the best in history unemployment for African Americans, best in history unemployment Hispanic Americans, best in history unemployment Asian Americans. You're the elite. You're the elite. But they said they'll do it again because this has been a total bust. They'll do it again. And by the way, the Senate's been so professional, so good, so strong, so solid. Just like these gentlemen in the House. So solid. So we have to vote these crazy people the hell out of office. And in 2020 I'm going to work like hell that we take over the House. We have to take over the House. We have to. Right? Got to take over the House, Mike. So here are the facts that Shifty Schiff \\u2026 Is that guy the worst? He comes up to a microphone, now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago, \\\"I have absolute proof that the President of the United States conspired with Russia.\\\" Russia? What the hell do I have to do with Russia? By the way, Russia wishes that Hillary Clinton won. They wish. We are now number one in the world in energy. Russia is number three. We're beating out Russia and Saudi Arabia. You'd have windmills all over the place if you had Crooked Hillary. They'd be knocking out those birds left and right. Those windmills. Wah, wah, wah. \\\"Darling, I want to watch television tonight and there's no damn wind. What do I do? I want to watch the election results. Darling, there's no wind. The damn wind just isn't blowing like it used to because of global warming, I think. I think it's global warming. Global warming. No more wind, no more life. The ocean is going to rise 1/8 of an inch within the next 250 years. We're going to be wiped out!\\\" Look, I want clean air. I want clean water, crystal clean, I want, and that's what we have at a record level. Our air and our water are cleaner now than it's ever been with all that we're doing, and we haven't closed up all of our industry, and we haven't closed up our businesses and lost all those jobs. And right now, we're by far the largest economy in the world. If you remember, you could look, if you go back five, six, seven years, in 2019 they say China was going to catch us as the world's largest economy. Guess what? They're way behind. They're way behind. Because over the last three years, you see the stock market set 131 records from the day. Think of that. And that means jobs, that means 401ks. I have so many people that come up to me, \\\"Thank you, sir. My wife is so in love with me because I went up 79% in the 401k. She thinks I'm a genius. She always thought I was a total stiff, a dumb, stupid dope. Now she thinks I'm a financial genius, sir. And all I did was buy some stock. I have stock in a 401k, and you made me into a genius, sir. She loves me so much more than she ever did.\\\" Shows you the power of money, right? Isn't that terrible? But I have so many people, 401ks are through the roof, your jobs are through the roof, we have the lowest unemployment rate. And now, more importantly than anything, wages are up for the first time in many, many years, decades, decades. You remember four years ago I was here, and I told people, I said, \\\"You know, 20 years ago, people made more money than they made four years ago.\\\" Not now. Not anymore. Because people now can not only make a lot more money, if they don't like their job, they go out and they get a different job, and they get more money, and ultimately they find one that they love. You have so many opportunities right now. Wages are up, jobs are up. And today we set a new record, almost 160 million people are working. We've never come close to that number. That's a hell of a number. But just quickly, here are the facts on Shifty Schiff. Dishonest guy, makes up my statements. He said, \\\"The President of Ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure,\\\" but he didn't want to say that. We said, \\\"Say it. Say it, you crooked bastard, say it. But he doesn't want to say it. We said, \\\"Sat it!\\\" I'd like to force him to say it. He'll walk up to the mic, \\\"Ladies and gentlemen,\\\" guy's a total corrupt guy. Listen, just to finish off, a man who I really, I don't know him, but I respect him because the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, and he said it so strongly, \\\"I have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance.\\\" He just said that the Democrats, who are corrupt, refuse to say that, and that's ultimately the only one that matters, the leaders of Ukraine, because they're the ones that know of this pressure, not some crooked ambassador that's a deep stater, or that's a Bushy, or that's a Clintonite, or that's a Barack Obama ambassador. Okay? The ones that matter are the leadership of the country that we're talking about. They refuse to say it because they're dishonest people. There's only one way to stop the rabid partisan Democrats, Pennsylvania voters must show up in 2020 so we can take back the House, hold the Senate, and keep the White House. It's the only way. Only way. Okay, so I'm going to ask these people to come up on this stage because we have warriors with us tonight. We love warriors, like the guys that killed al-Baghdadi. You know how much press I got? I don't care about press. But Conan the dog got more than I did, and that's okay. Conan was almost electrocuted, he deserves it. They gave me about a day, and that's okay, because the people understand, we made a great decision. And remember this, al-Baghdadi was the founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi was a vicious, ruthless person, al-Baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the State of Ohio. Think of that, that's a big caliphate. And we now have taken 100% of the caliphate, and we have thousands and thousands of ISIS prisoners. With Obama, you did nothing. You did nothing but get your ass kicked. True. True. All right, we're joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways. They fight for us. They really are incredible. And they come right from the State of Pennsylvania. Hey, do you ever notice where Biden keeps saying he's in the wrong state? Like if he's in Ohio, \\\"It's great to be an Iowa tonight.\\\" If he's in Pennsylvania, \\\"It's wonderful to be in the State of Delaware.\\\" What is wrong with this guy? What's wrong with him? There's something wrong. Okay? There's something wrong. No, he keeps \\u2026 How many times can you do that? So far, it could happen, because you know I was doing six and seven a day that last month, that last beautiful month that I loved, I was doing six. I left these guys alone. I didn't want to do interviews, they were a waste of time. We just did these big beautiful rallies. And you know, if you start getting a little \\u2026 you know, I went to Michigan, then I went to Wisconsin, then I went \\u2026 I'm sitting here saying, \\\"What the hell is going on? These crowds are incredible.\\\" And we had the biggest crowds. By the way, to this day, there has never been, and they'll always correct me, in the history of politics, in the history of our country, there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw, and I don't have a guitar. I have no guitar. But this has never happened. I mean if you took Ronald Reagan, and we all like Ronald Reagan, I liked him, I thought he was a great guy, but if he came to Pennsylvania for a rally, if he had 1,000 people in a ballroom or something, you know? I mean we're getting crowds, 25-30,000 people, and then there'll be 20,000 people outside. We set up screens outside, and if anybody would like to stand in the rain watching. And do you people out there, I'm sorry, it's pretty rough. But no, there's never been anything like it. One instruction get me the biggest arena you can get. We don't have empty seats. I mean look at this. How many seats is this? 11,000? How much? 10,500, it's packed. It's beyond that. And don't forget, look at the floor, and then you go out. No, and then you go out and you look outside, and you have thousands and thousands because there's a spirit for what we're doing. We're fixing our country, we're healing our country. We're making America great again. So I want to ask a couple of our great warriors to come forward. Representative Glenn Thompson, come up here, Glenn. Come up here. A man that's been a friend of mine for a long time, Mike Kelly. Don't get in the fight with Mike. Come up, Mike. A wonderful man who represents this area, Scott Perry. Representative Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd. A guy who was always there for us, John Joyce. And two people that you all know very well in this state, they bring home the bacon, Dan Meuser and Fred Keller. Thank you fellas. Thank you. I want to also bring back our Pennsylvania Party Chairman. And I know his grandfather, I shouldn't say that to you. He was a tremendous man, Dan Tabas, but I'm going to introduce somebody that Dan always said had tremendous talent. Little did I know that he'd be working with us, and he's really working well. He's smart, he's tough. Lawrence Tabas. Come on up, Lawrence. Come on up. Also with us tonight, Pennsylvania Trump Victory Chairwoman, Bernie. You know this, right? You know this person. Comfort. Do you know who that is? Do you know who that is? Everybody knows who that is. National Committeeman Bob Asher, RNC Co-chairman Tommy Hicks has been incredible, and my friend David Urban. David. So I just want to thank, this is an amazing group of people, and with their help, and the help of everyone here, we are going to set records like we've never set before. You know, I used to say, and I sort of still have to say, 2016, I don't know if anything like that can ever happen, but I think we're much better. All of the things I said, \\\"We're going to cut taxes. We're going to cut regulations. We're going to take care of our vets,\\\" look what we did for our vets, with choice, right? Look what we did. Look what we did. We now have the ability to fire all of the bad people that are in the VA. Right? Fired over 8,000 people that were disrespecting our vets. They wouldn't have done it in primetime, I can tell you that. But what we've done for our vets, what we've done in rebuilding our military, what we've done in so many ways, and we, unlike the Democrats, will protect your Second Amendment. Okay? So we've done a job, and we're proud of it, and we have tremendous people. Let's give them a hand, and thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, folks. Vote for these people. Even if you don't like them, vote for them. Oh, that's a beautiful new hat. Look at the hat that guy's got on. How's that hat working out? Is that good? I love that hat. Look at this guy, that says Keep America Great. Should we do the poll? Should we do a poll? Okay, ready? So we have the greatest phrase in the history of politics, Make America Great Again. Wait. And we have our new phrase, because we've made America great. I've told you, stock market, we've rebuilt our military, we've cut your taxes at a level that nobody could even think possible. Take a look at your median income, take a look at what's happened. The numbers, median household income, take a look at your numbers. With President Bush, it went up $400 in eight years. With President Obama, it went up $975 in eight years. With President Trump, it went up 5,000, but whoa, whoa, whoa, in less than three years. That's a big thing. Wait. And then when you add energy savings, and you add tax savings, you have almost a $10,000 gain in three years. That's a big difference. And that's one of the very big reasons why our, I think that and regulations, but that's one of the very big reasons why our economy is doing so well, because they talk about our consumer is loaded with money. Thank you very much, Mr. President, I appreciate it. But with the help of everyone here, we have now the hottest economy. You know when I meet dictators, and presidents, and kings, and queens, and prime ministers, they all come into that beautiful Oval Office. So beautiful, right? So respected. And the first thing they almost always say, \\\"Sir, congratulations on your economy. We're trying to do the same thing.\\\" I said, \\\"You won't be able to do it. You won't.\\\" They won't be able to. Let them give it a shot. But they all say, \\\"Congratulations on the great job you've done with economy.\\\" But we've all done the great job. Not me. We've all done it. I've been your spokesman, and I've done a good job as spokesman. But they all say that. But we've done a good job in many ways. You know, all of the promises that I made, I'm the only politician in history that I've actually kept more promises than I made. Think of that. In other words, I made here, like a thing like Right to Try, nobody talked about Right to Try. We got Right to Try. That's somebody terminally ill, we have the greatest medicines in the world, the greatest doctors, the greatest labs in the world, nobody close, but it takes years to get it approved. And I got it approved so you can sign a document, get it. If you want to see the lives that we're saving, it's a beautiful thing. A beautiful thing is happening, Right to Try. Right to Try. But we've also created 7 million new jobs since the election. If I would have said that, the fake news would have gone crazy, they would have said that's impossible. These people would have gone crazy. They go crazy anyway, and I don't even say it. And right here in Pennsylvania, we've created 160, 000 brand new beautiful jobs, and you have companies moving in and moving back. And as I said, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment, the lowest ever in the history of our country, the lowest unemployment rates. Wages for low income workers have gone up more than 10%. Nobody thought that was possible. They're one of the biggest, in terms of a group, one of the biggest beneficiaries. This year, 40 million American families will benefit from the Republican Child Tax Credit, each receiving an average of $2,200. We ended the last administration's war on American energy, the United States is now, and I said it, and I'll say it all night long, number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, and there's nobody even close. In the State of Pennsylvania, natural gas production is up 34% since our election, 34. Virtually every leading Democrat has pledged to entirely eliminate American production of oil, clean coal, natural gas. I don't think somebody coming into Pennsylvania, you know those new petrochemical plants, they don't like them at all. Thousands and thousands of jobs. Incredible. Millions of dollars in taxes. How about going to the State of Texas? We had one candidate who turned out not to be too good a candidate, right? Beto, Beto. Remember? So he wanted to get rid of religion, the Bible, he wanted to get rid of guns, and he wanted to get rid of oil. How about going to Texas and say, \\\"No Bible, no oil,\\\" think of this one, \\\"No Bible, no oil, no guns.\\\" I think you could be Abraham Lincoln and not win that particular race. And it wouldn't be much different in the State of Pennsylvania, that I can tell you. But you know, somebody that believes in that is Sleepy Joe Biden. He was caught telling a far left radical activist that he would shut down fossil fuel production in Pennsylvania. You saw that. But the voters of this Commonwealth will never, ever let that happen. Can you imagine a guy coming in, whether it's him or anybody else? They all want to do it. He just raises his hand, he has no clue what he's doing. They raise their hand. Remember he looked? Do you want to give illegal aliens healthcare, even though we're taking it away from our own soldiers that are up \\u2026 and he looks and they're all raising their hand? Did you see that? Well, he, \\\"Oh, oh, oh, okay, I'll do it too.\\\" In addition to replacing NAFTA, I've taken the toughest ever action against China's trade abuses. They want to make a deal so badly. And we're doing well with the deal, but they want to make a deal. \\\"Please make a deal. We don't want to pay tariffs anymore. Please, please.\\\" Thanks to our steel tariffs, steel mills in Pennsylvania are roaring back to life. And U.S. Steel has just announced $1 billion investment in Mon Valley Works in Pittsburgh. You know that, right? $1 billion. They weren't investing, they were divesting. The steel companies, it's an amazing achievement. We tax all of the dumped steel, comes in from China and other places, 25%. \\u2026 the dump steel comes in from China and other places. 25%. All of it. All of a sudden our steel mills are doing again. We need steel. It's not like you could say, \\\"Gee, we'll get it from another country.\\\" We need that for defense. We need it for our ships, we need it for our planes. We need it. We can't play games with steel. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. Very importantly, in everything we do, we are putting America first. Sorry. We gave up on the globalist folks. Let's build the world. Let's forget about our country. Let's just rebuild the world. Or no issue have the Democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the American people than on the issue of immigration. Far left politician\\u2026 I mean, they're fighting me on the wall, you have no idea. But we're building it and it's fine and we have the money coming in from the military. I've got it from here, from there, from there. Believe me, if I weren't a good developer, you could forget about that wall. I've got here, there, there. These people fought me and we've started winning in court. You know what? Speaking of court, we will soon have 182 federal judges, including Court of Appeals. Nobody can believe it. All because Barack Obama gave us 142 empty seats. When you're a president, they always say, \\\"I disagree. I think the most important thing we can do is defense,\\\" right? But beyond defense, they always say the most important thing you can do is judges and justices of the Supreme Court. We have two great ones. Great ones. But they always say, \\\"Judges and Supreme Court justices.\\\" When you leave office, I hope in 5 years, 9 years, 13 years, 17 years, 21 years, 25 years, 29 years. When I leave office\\u2026 Now I'm only doing that to drive them totally crazy. That drives them crazy. Even joking about it. We have this idiot comedian who stands up, he's talking to a guest, right? He said, \\\"You know he's going to win, don't you? You know it.\\\" The guy goes, \\\"No, no. We're going to fight. We're going to fight.\\\" And they will. \\\"No, no, no. You know he's going to win.\\\" Then he goes, \\\"You know he's going to win. And you know he's never leaving, don't you? He's never leaving.\\\" At first I thought he was kidding. He's a whack job. He is totally serious. He honestly believes that. I don't know, should we give it a shot? Maybe we'll give it a shot. I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. Media, I'm only kidding. They won't write that, but that's okay. They won't write the, \\\"I'm only kidding part.\\\" But far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their sneering contempt, scorned and disdained for everyday Americans. These jurisdictions deliberately release dangerous, violent, criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets, where they are free to offend, where they are free to kill, where they are free to rape, where they are free to beat up people except for ICE because ICE is much tougher than them. They don't beat up ICE. They don't beat up ICE. You're lucky we have ICE. They want to put ICE out of business. That's not happening. ICE is\\u2026 They're incredible people. They're great patriots and they're tough. Thanks to Democrat immigration policies, innocent Americans in all 50 states are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals. Last summer, at least 19 illegal aliens were charged in connection with grizzly homicides, including hacking victims to death and ripping out, in two cases, their hearts. Weeks ago, two illegal aliens and members of the savage gang, MS-13, who we are removing from our country by the thousands, were charged with relentlessly beating a wonderful, beautiful high school teenager to death with a baseball bat and chopping the body apart with a machete. One of the animals accused was previously released by local authorities in defiance of an ICE demand. ICE warned and said, \\\"You can't let them go.\\\" They wanted them. They would do anything for them. They wanted them to hand this animal over for deportation back to his country. Get them the hell out of our country, right? Democrats' sanctuary cities also give safe haven to those who commit violent sex crimes. Since Montgomery County, Maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in July, we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape, sexual assault, including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young, wonderful woman who was entering her apartment, innocently entering her apartment. She was raped and killed, strangled to death. Sanctuary city. Maryland. But these are only the cases we know about. Sanctuary cities and jails actively conceal illegal alien crime and criminals from federal government. Federal government wants to take them out, or in some cases, if it's real violence, and we don't want to pay for the cost, but we do, put them into very strong jails. The sanctuary city of Philadelphia. The sanctuary city in Philadelphia is one of the very worst sanctuaries anywhere in America. Did you know that? I mean, I know Philadelphia well. Going to school here, we never heard about sanctuary cities, did we? Weeks ago an illegal alien charged with rape, sexual assault of a child, and inflicting serious bodily injury was released by Philadelphia to wander free in your communities. By the way, you may have the worst district attorney or whatever the hell you call it. This guy, I've been hearing about this guy, he lets killers out almost immediately. What the hell? How did you let that happen? Instead of handing them over while still in jail, they defied ICE. They fought with ICE and set him loose upon an unsuspecting family. Thankfully, at great time and effort, our brave ICE officers were eventually able to track him down, arrest him, detain him, and do what has to be done. How do you elect Democrats when they create a sanctuary city of Philadelphia? I don't get it. Four MS-13 gang members were also arrested in Pennsylvania in connection with the brutal and sadistic murders of a 21-year-old and a 15-year-old. As we speak, a criminal illegal alien with three prior deportations is roaming free in Pennsylvania because he was released by the city of Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. You better get yourself a new prosecutor in this place, I want to tell you. That's a horrible thing. No, it's a national story, how he wants everybody to not pay the price. You're talking about not paying the price for rape, for murder, for other horrible crimes. How stupid can you be? The charges against this alien include rape, aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, indecent exposure, and terroristic threats. Other than that, he was a very nice person. Philadelphia has defied ICE and released illegals charged with everything from assault, to kidnapping, to drug crimes, to sex crimes, to homicide murder. Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law and order, and we stand for justice. We stand for justice. We side with law enforcement and with law-abiding Americans, not ruthless gang members and not violent criminals, aliens that come into our country illegally. They take our payments. Payments. Some of these people with these crazy laws that you have. Look at what's going on in California. They do better than our great veterans. They do better than citizens of our country. And they advertise, \\\"We will take you. We will take care of you. We will pay for it.\\\" And then you wonder why we have so many people trying to come through at the borders. But we do a great job. We're removing these criminal illegal aliens from our country by the thousands. We're sending them home, and we're not letting them come back in. We're being very tough. Mexico is now giving us 27,000 soldiers at our border. And Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we signed a very important agreement with each. When their people come into our country, they weren't taking them back. Now they take them back and they say, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" They weren't taking them back. If we had a murderer from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, we want to bring them back under past administrations. They bring them and they say, \\\"We don't want them. Don't land. You're playing with us.\\\" They say, \\\"Thank you very much. We will take them back.\\\" Because we've let them know the price is very bad if they don't do that. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossings are down 75% since May and the wall is going up at a very rapid pace. The radical Democrats have gotten more and more extreme. That's why they did this impeachment hoax, because Nancy Pelosi had absolutely no control. She knew what was going to happen. She knew. The radical left has taken over the Democrat party. Democrats are pushing for a socialist takeover of healthcare that would strip you of the doctor and coverage of your choice. We have 180 million people with private healthcare that love it. They're going to take it away from you. I don't think so. Crazy Elizabeth Warren, or as I affectionately call her, Pocahontas, her ridiculous plan would cost $52 trillion. That's more money than we take in in one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, six years, about seven years. That's for one year. $52 trillion. And you don't have your doctor. I mean, the whole\\u2026 Well, she's starting to crash again. I thought I knocked her down. I did that heavy, heavy Pocahontas deal. I give her credit. I thought she was left for\\u2026 I mean, there were just little embers, and then she rose. She rose, then she became strong. But then she opened that fresh mouth of hers and it stopped. It stopped. I don't see her as a threat. I don't think she makes it. I mean, you don't know. Crazy things are happening in the Democrat party. It used to be a sane party. Now it's an insane party. So you don't know. But they're all looking at the same thing. I mean, you have Alfred E. Neuman who's running, who's this guy. This guy Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Can you believe he's doing well? He's like the leading fundraiser. I dream about him. It's true. No, Buttigieg. But I'm not going too far with any of these people because I thought I was way too early with Elizabeth Warren. We destroyed her too fast. So she came back. But she's going back down again. Did anybody see her beer deal where she said, \\\"Darling.\\\" Did you ever see that deal? Darling. It's about her husband. Darling, it's great to see you. What are you doing here? It's like, \\\"That's her husband, he's supposed to be living in the house. You're here.\\\" I don't think she's seen him in 10 years. Hey, I have an idea. Can I get a beer? Let's get a beer. She wants to be one of the group. Hey, let's get a beer. Did you ever see such a phony, disgusting deal? Republicans will defend your sacred right to choose the doctor, and you can choose your plan, and you choose the plan that's right for you. We will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions. We will also protect your right to get the physician that you want. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth. This character in Virginia. Did you see the Virginia governor? I mean, he gave a whole expose. The baby is born, and then basically, they start talking to the mother. The baby is born. And there's no other word. If the mother decides no, then they execute the baby. Okay? He's the governor of Virginia and why the Republicans aren't going to win Virginia this next election, 2020. I'll tell you what, we're going to give it a very strong shot. When you have people like that, we're going to give it a very strong shot. But that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion. Because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the party of honest Abe Lincoln. Party of Abe Lincoln. I told you about judges. I'm telling you about so many other things. There's nobody that's ever done what we're doing. You look at school choice for every child in America who needs it, including the 50,000 Pennsylvania students who your Democrat governor has blocked from getting school choice scholarships. No scholarships available. What's that all about? How did that happen? I withdrew from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal, a disaster. I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Pennsylvania. You've never had that better year. Never At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation itself. It's the survival. We will destroy our country if these people get in. I say we've done so much in the first three years, will soon be four years. All of a sudden the time will be up. But it's like when you plant a tree, it needs time to grab on. It needs time to let it\\u2026 It's got to grab. That's what we need. We need time. And we have other things we're going to do that are incredible. We still have tremendous regulation cutting that we can do. We've cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country. We did it in less than two and a half years. Two and a half years. We did it in less than two and a half years. Some had eight years, one had more than eight years. More regulation. And we have regulation, and you need some regulation, but you don't need regulation that doesn't allow you to build a simple road or highway. So what we've done has been incredible. That's one of the reasons our job numbers are so good. If you want your children to inherit the birthright of American Liberty that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020, and we have to get rid of the Democrats in the House of Representatives. They are stone cold crazy. Only this way can we save the America we love and clean up Washington corruption once and for all. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. We have tremendous prosperity going on in our country, and the people in this room are\\u2026 I mean, you know what's happening. You know what's happening with your families. You know what's happening with your jobs. You've never had a time like this. They always say, \\\"Are you better off now than you were four years ago?\\\" I mean, who is better off now? Everybody, I think. Everybody. But together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, \\\"Made in the USA.\\\" We just finished a deal with South Korea, a great new trade deal. We just finished a $40 billion deal with Japan. We're in the process of getting our deal done. Let's see what happens. They want to make it more than I do with because we're taking in a lot of money. We haven't taken in money from China ever, and it's coming in now by the billions. When they target our farmer, I give our farmers that money that they've been targeted and our farmers are thrilled. We have a lot leftover, but we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We'll have that done within 10 years. It could have started. That could have started earlier than the beginning of our administration. We'll have that done in less than 10 years. Think of that. The AIDS epidemic will have ended in America within less than 10 years. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, one great country. One America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of generations of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. Pennsylvania's the place where our founding fathers declared American independence, where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington led his men across the Delaware on Christmas night. They used the password. You know what the password was? Victory or death. Victory or death. How incredible is that? Victory or death. Pennsylvania is the state that gave us self-made titans of American industry, from Andrew Carnegie to Milton Hershey. I love Hershey. I love Hershey. And Henry J. Heinz. Pennsylvania is the place where strong American workers mine the coal, work the railroads, and forge the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it even greater every single day. It's greater than ever before. And proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. They are trying to take your power away. It will never ever happen. With your help, and with your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are going to keep on winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. Ladies and gentlemen of Pennsylvania, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you.\",\n          \" Wow, thank you. Thank you, New Mexico. Thank you. We love being with you. We love being with you. Incredible people, incredible people. Thank you very much. And I'm thrilled to be here in Albuquerque with thousands of hard-working, freedom-loving American patriots. Thank you. Incredible. We're all united by the same love of our great country. And by the way, our country is doing great. You see it. The same devotion to family and the same profound faith that America is blessed by, the eternal grace of Almighty God. Good night to that person. Tomorrow they'll say, \\\"Massive protest.\\\" No, one person just going home to mommy a little bit sooner. Good night. But we're bound by these convictions. We will campaign for every vote, and we will win the great state of New Mexico in 2020. And by the way, you have thousands and thousands of people outside who can't get in. So we love you, we love you, we appreciate it. We try to get the biggest arena we can get, and they're never big enough, frankly. So there's something going on. And I always say, 2016, I don't know if there'll ever be another 2016. But right now it's like a great tree or a great plant, you plant it and it has to take hold. We have to win 2020. We're doing so well. We have to win 2020. And every day, and you know as well as I do, we're battling against the corrupt establishment of the past, and we're achieving historic victories for the American people. We're winning again. We're winning again, and we're winning big. We're winning big. Crucially for your state, we have ended the last administration's war on American energy. And since my election, natural gas productions, big story today, in New Mexico has increased by 40%, 4-0. And that means great wages, and it means jobs. And that's why you're breaking every single record in your state's book. Crude oil production in New Mexico has more than doubled, and going up a lot higher very quickly. And your state's energy revenues are up by nearly two-thirds. Think of that. Two-thirds. And that's in a short period of time. Give me a little bit more time, okay? The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And this means more jobs, higher wages, and American energy independence, which is what we have. A few years ago, if we had a problem like you saw two days ago in the Middle East, we would've been in a panic. Although, not if I were your president. We never panic. We don't want to panic. But a few years ago, they would have been in a panic. Today we got a lot of oil, we got a lot of gas. We got a lot of oil and gas. We don't have to send too many boats over there. Did you notice the other day, they were saying, \\\"We don't see too many American ships anymore.\\\" You know why? Because we don't need \\u2026 We're independent, as independent as we want. And we are now a net exporter of energy. Revenues from energy production provide up to 25% of your state's budget and going much higher in the very near future. And they've generated nearly a billion-dollar budget surplus in New Mexico. Thank you very much, president Trump. Thank you. Now, under the Green New Deal, that all goes away. That all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric. Single car. You're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles. They'll call us \\\"the hermit nation.\\\" We'll never leave our house. No, it's crazy. But that's okay. I don't want to bring it up because I don't want to do it too early. Maybe they'll change, and I don't want them to change. But think of it for you, and for Texas, and for so many other places, they want to get rid of your energy. I mean, explain that one. Explain that. Yet, every major Democrat running for president, they want to abolish all production of oil and natural gas. In other words, the Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico's economy. The Democrats want us to be subservient to foreign producers. They want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes. That's not happening anymore. It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It's not happening anymore. But Democrats will never get the chance because New Mexico will never give them that chance. Under this administration, America is working again. America is winning again. And America is respected again, like it hasn't been for a long time. And I can tell you because I meet so many of the leaders, and their presidents, and their kings, and their queens, and their prime ministers, and their everything, dictators every once in a while. Every once in a while, you get an a rogue dictator. And I'll tell you, they always start off, today I had the Crown Prince of Bahrain, and they come in and they say, \\\"Sir, I'd like to congratulate you on what you've done with the economy of the United States. It's a model for the entire world.\\\" They all say it. And earlier today \\u2026 Do we have any baseball fans? Right? Right? You know what I'm going to say. But earlier today in the White House, I had the honor of awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom, that's the highest civilian award, to someone who truly embodies the American dream, baseball legend, the greatest, by the way, the greatest relief pitcher of all time, you look at those records, Mariano Rivera. He was something. The Yankees won a lot of World Series because of Mariano. Great guy. We gave him the medal. Done so much for charity. A fantastic man, fantastic family. It was a beautiful day at the White House, so it was good. My administration is fighting to empower all Americans to reach their dreams and achieve their potential. We have created six million new jobs since election day. The fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign, even as a projection. Unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in over 50 years. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Nearly 600,000 Americans came into the labor force last month alone. Think of that. Wages in your state, New Mexico, are growing at a rate of much more than 3% a year, which is unheard of 20 years ago. And I used to say during the campaign, you go back, it's hard to believe, I'm here almost three years \\u2026 Can you believe how time is flying? Can you believe it? I don't know about it me, but you look all much better than you did three years ago. You're wealthier. And even with the Me Too movement, we can't say this, but I'll say it anyway, you're better looking, including the men, including the men. Now you're all looking good. Since my election, the number of new business applications for New Mexico has increased by almost 30%, more than any state in the United States. Think of that. More than any state in the United States. So essentially, that's saying you're in a certain category, which is a very important category, you're doing better than any state in the United States. How do I lose New Mexico? Explain that one, right? How do we lose that one? And yet, for whatever reason, it's been quite a while since a Republican won this state. But we're going to win this state. And I think we're going to win this state easy. You had to see the people all the way in from the airport. That was a long drive by the way, 35 minutes. That was a long drive. But all the way in, we had people, and they were waving. And I didn't see any negative hand gesture, right? No, I think we're going to do great here. And we're here for a number of reasons, but we're here because we really think we're going to turn this state and make it a Republican state. Yesterday marked the beginning of the Hispanic Heritage Month. Who is Hispanic here? Latinos for Trump. Thank you. Incredible people. But we have much to celebrate. Unbelievable when you think, the unemployment for Hispanic-Americans is right now at the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic-American poverty reached a brand new all-time low in history. And after years of stagnation that you know very well, wages for Hispanic-Americans are rising really fast, up nearly 8% since my election. Those are unheard of numbers. They're unheard of. And median income, think of that, median income for Hispanic-Americans surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever. That's your median. That's not bad. That means you're wealthy and you're getting wealthier fast. And I just want to tell you it's an honor. But when I'm on the debate stage debating one of these far left radical Democrats, whoever it may be, and they start telling you what they're going to do for you, and you say, \\\"But we have the best numbers, every category, that we've ever had.\\\" Hispanic-Americans \\u2026 excuse me, New Mexico as a whole, we have the best numbers. African-Americans, the best numbers that we've ever had in the history of our country. Asian-Americans, the best numbers that we've ever had in history. Women, the best numbers that we've had in 71 years. We're working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for our nation's Hispanic-American citizens, including millions and millions of extraordinary Mexican-Americans who enrich our society, strengthen our country, serve in our military, and contribute immensely to our shared American family. And I want to just tell you that Mexico is doing a great job for us on the border, and I want to thank the president of Mexico. You know, it's very interesting, I hear everybody screaming, well, you know we're building the wall, and it's going up, and it's going up fast. And if you think that's easy with the Democrats who control the House, we have to take it back, but if you think it's easy \\u2026 But we're building a lot of wall. We'll have almost 500 miles of wall built by the end the next year, and it's making a big difference. 500 miles. But you know we won a big case two months ago in the Supreme Court that allowed us to do what we're doing. This has been \\u2026 I'll tell you what. Ready? Another president would have given up a long time ago. We don't give up. So we're building the wall, the Army Corps of Engineers, we're doing a beautiful job. It's a great, it's a great structure. It's a great structure. You're going to have to really want to get over that wall, to do it. But it was very interesting because, not too long ago, I saw where the Hispanic-American, the Hispanics, were up with me in a poll, 17%. And everyone said, \\\"How is that? How is that? How is that? 17%. Up by 17%. I won't even tell you what the final number was because they won't believe it, but you're going to see what the final number \\u2026 But you know why? Because the Hispanic-Americans, they understand, they don't want criminals coming across the border. They don't want people taking their jobs. They want to have that security, and they want the wall. They want the wall. And we have a man in the audience who is, I think, the best dressed man in this entire place, including me, right here. Look at him. Come here. Look at him. Look at this guy. And he's been to a couple of rallies too, haven't you? Huh? We have some people, a group of people the other day, you know, we had a victory in North Carolina that was unbelievable. Two of them. One of them, it was going to be very, very close. Here's another one of my friends. Thank you. I like that beautiful red tie you're wearing. But we had a victory, two victories, North Carolina, where one was 17 points down three weeks ago, we got involved, we started sending out lots of different social media messages, we did a couple of little robo calls, but the big thing, we did a speech the night before. The turnout was beyond belief. And instead of being down by 17 points, he easily won the election 4,000 or 5,000 votes. Dan, thank you, Dan. Thank you, Dan Bishop. And Greg Murphy was up a couple of points, and he ended up winning, I don't know, I'd ask the media, but they won't give me how many \\u2026 What did he get? Do you know? Like 20, 21? He won by a lot. He won by a lot. I'd asked them, but we're not going to get a straight answer. They were not happy. They were not happy. I'll tell you, Tuesday night, the fake news was not happy. They had their studios all built. CNN had their A- list talent. They don't have A-list talent, but they had the best they could have. And they were all set. This was going to be the end of Trump, because this man was going to lose. But he turned out to be tough and smart. And in all fairness, I helped a lot too. And toward the end of the night, they started dismantling that studio. Probably it would have been there for four weeks. This is the end. But we had two great victories, congressional victories, on Tuesday night. And it was something. The one gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible, so much. And the other won a race that he was way, way, way back. In fact, I shouldn't tell you this, but my geniuses, my people, some of those people standing right there, right there, some of them right there, they said, \\\"Sir, don't get involved in that race, sir. You can't come back from 17 points, sir. It's too much.\\\" I said, \\\"But you know, I really like the guy. I think he's great. Let's give it a shot.\\\" They say, \\\"Sir, if you lose, they will never, ever \\u2026 It'll be much worse.\\\" I said, \\\"Let me tell you, I know them very well. Whether I help him or don't help him, it's going to be the same. It's going to be a disaster. So let's help him.\\\" And we campaigned, and we worked hard, right? They said, \\\"Don't do it, sir. Don't do it. Please don't do it, sir. It'll be very embarrassing.\\\" I said, \\\"No, I don't mind being embarrassed. I don't mind being embarrassed.\\\" We're also very proud that unemployment among Native Americans has reached the lowest rate in nearly two decades. And we're building an amazing future for citizens of every background, race, religion, color, and creed. And that's what we have. That's what we have. Race, religion, color, and creed. But the radical left Democrats want to demolish everything that we've gained. They want to raise your taxes. They want to bury you in regulation. They want to take away your health insurance, 180 million Americans. They want to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology. And left-wing Democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your God-given right to self-defense. You know that. As your president, I will never allow them to take away your liberty, your dignity, and your social security. And I will never, ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms. The left tries to threaten, bully, intimidate Americans into submission. They use Democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can. They'll do whatever they can to demean you, to libel you. They try to blacklist, coerce, cancel, or destroy anyone who gets in their way. Look at what they're doing today to Justice Kavanaugh. Look at what they're doing. Did you see the New York Times? Did you see what they're doing? Did you see what Democrats, they're calling for his resignation. They're calling for his impeachment. And the woman involved said she didn't know anything. But they still, so the New York Times had to put out a major apology, and they had to change their story. The woman said, \\\"I don't remember that.\\\" Can you believe? And they still want him to be impeached. And I just put out a statement. And he's a great man, by the way, a great talent. A great brilliant man, Brett Kavanaugh. and I just put out a statement on social media that said, I don't think they'll do it, but they should, for the good of the nation, \\\"I call for the resignation of everybody at the New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh smear story.\\\" And while you're at it, the Russian witch-hunt hoax, which is just as phony a story. They've taken, the old gray lady, do you know the New York Times, for years, the old gray lady, so prestigious, they've taken the old great lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue, and ruined her reputation. She can never recover, and will never return to greatness under current management. The Times is dead. Long live The New York Times. Long lived The New York Times. And I do want it to live, but they have to be, they have to change their ways. Think of it, they wrote a story about somebody that said she doesn't remember this. Can you even believe it? And yet, all of these radical left crazies are in judiciary committee and all of these committees that are set up to hurt the country. With all that we have going, with Saudi Arabia, with Iran, with China trade deal, with Russia, with North Korea, with all that we have going, look at the cards that we've been dealt, lucky we won the election in 2016, believe me. With all that we have going, they say, \\\"Let's impeach Justice Kavanaugh,\\\" one of the smartest, most brilliant students, top at Yale, incredible life, incredible family. \\\"Let's impeach him.\\\" It's a made-up story. \\\"Let's impeach President Trump.\\\" Think of that. The Muller Report came out. Think of this. This crazy Mueller Report comes out, 18 Trump haters, liberal Democrats, some worked for Hillary Clinton, they found nothing. No, think of it. After two years, they found nothing. They spent $40 million. There's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that. They spent, think of it, they found nothing. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. To stop the far left's campaign of destruction, you must vote Republican. And you're going to get the chance very soon. We're joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and somebody that's done an incredible job, she ran Michigan for me. And as you know, for the presidential races, Michigan hadn't been won in decades, and she kept saying, \\\"Could you come back, sir?\\\" I didn't know who she was. I said, \\\"Who the heck is the woman in Michigan that keeps asking?\\\" She said, \\\"Sir, if you keep coming back, you're going to win Michigan.\\\" Hasn't been won in decades. And I won Michigan. Remember that great, great night? November. That great, great night. \\\"Donald Trump has won the great state of Michigan.\\\" And they were going crazy on television. They were going, that was not a good night- Going crazy on television. They were going, that was not a good night for certain people. Remember the couple of people that were crying? I guess they don't like a strong military. They don't like cutting regulations. They don't like low taxes. They don't like Right to Try, you know Right to Try. All these things we've done. For the Vets, we got choice. We got choice for the Vets. Choice. Everybody said it was impossible. We've rebuilt our military. I told this story for the first time today. A general came into my office in my first few weeks, you remember? It was a little dangerous out there. President Obama left us with a few beauties, right? And I said to this general, \\\"You better be prepared, because this is looking like it could really be conflict.\\\" And he looked at me and he goes, \\\"Sir, we have very little ammunition.\\\" I said, \\\"Say it again.\\\" And I want to tell you the words, very little, he didn't use because it was less than that. And I said, \\\"I never want to see a president in a position like that, where we may have conflict, and a general looks at him and said, \\u2018We have very little/ no ammunition.'\\\" I never want a president of the United States to be in that position. And since then, three years, $700 billion we've spent, then $716 billion. And now, $738 billion. And our military is by far the greatest in the world. There's nobody that even comes close. So anyway, no president should ever be put in that position. And by the way, no president should ever have to go through what I've gone through either. That should never happen. What happened is a disgrace to our country. No president should ever have to go through it. And I'll tell you what, 99% of them would never have been able to take it. They wouldn't have been able to take it. But we won the great state of Michigan, and now we're doing really well, because we've moved a lot of car companies. I tell Japan, sorry, big deficits with all these countries, we're changing it, but you've got to get car companies. We're building car companies now in Michigan. They're not going to be leaving for lots of other countries, including China, including Mexico. They're going to stay home, and they're going to pay you a lot of money, and everybody's going to be happy. But Michigan's doing great. And Ronna McDaniel was the Republican Party chair of Michigan. So when we won the election, I said, \\\"Let's get the woman from Michigan to run the RNC.\\\" And she has done an incredible job. Thank you Ronna. A great gentleman who loves the Republican Party, co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. Tommy, what a job. New Mexico Republican party chairman. Steve Pearce. My friend and a really talented guy, he just gets the hell knocked out of him all the time. Brad Parscale. What a job he's doing, Brad. Great job, Brad. Great job. And another great friend of mine, somebody that was on CNN, and they didn't like him because he was too positive on Trump. Can you believe it? He happens to be Hispanic. He happens to be Hispanic, but I've never quite figured it out, because he looks more like a wasp than I do. So I haven't figured that one out. But I'll tell you what. There is nobody that loves his country more or Hispanic more than Steve Cortez, Steve. Thank you Steve. Nobody loves the Hispanics more. Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics? He says the country. I don't know. I may have to go for the Hispanics to be honest. We got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote. You know, just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote, close to 90%. they gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award. And the Venezuelans and the Cubans are all for Trump, I will tell you that. They're all for Trump. They like what we're doing. With the help of, and Steve, I want to thank you very much by the way, and you were incredible on CNN, and now you'll get a real job. Okay? Steve, that audience wasn't big enough for you. Their ratings aren't good. With the help of everyone here tonight, we're taking power out of Washington and giving it back to the great people of our country, and to the people of New Mexico. We've cut a record number of job-killing regulations, saving the average American household $3,000. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. What that means is a typical family of four in New Mexico making $75,000 has seen their tax bill reduced by more than $2,000. And it's one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great, you look at Europe, and you look at Asia, and China's not doing too well. I must be honest with you, worst year in 57 years, I'd say that's not good. But I hope they still like me. And we've taken in tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs, and we've given those tariffs, and by the way, China's eating the tariffs, they're devaluing their currency, the prices are very similar. They're eating the tariffs. And out of the tens of billions we gave our great farmers, because they were targeted by China, because China knows, very smart, that the farmers love Trump, and Trump loves the farmers. I said to our Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, I said, \\\"Sonny, how much did the farmers get hit by China targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things?\\\" He said, \\\"$16 billion.\\\" I said, \\\"That's okay. We'll take $16 billion out of a much, much, much larger number. We're going to give it to the farmers, so that they're even.\\\" And I tell you, the farmers do love Trump, they do love Trump. And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches, and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax, so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children. Now, if you don't like your children, don't do it. But when it's your time to kick the bucket, you worked hard. You have great kids, you love your kids, they're taking care of you. You really love them. It's a great thing. If you don't love them, don't even listen to the last line, because it won't matter. Don't leave it to them. If they're not good, leave it to charity. Leave it to something else. Don't get it to them. I know a guy who can't stand his children, they're horrible, horrible human beings. They're a little older now, but they're horrible human beings. He wants to leave his wealth. I said, \\\"Why would you leave them? They don't even like you.\\\" But on the assumption that you love your children, you'll be able to use small farms and your ranches and things. You'll be able to leave them to your children. Your children won't have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax. They won't be losing it to the banks five years later. We got rid of it. That's a big deal. Thank you. Thank you. Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. For many decades, our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests. You know that, in New Mexico, you know exactly what I'm talking about. People came in, they took your jobs, they had no border, they had no border control. Look at what's going on now, how we're doing. I mean, honestly, I mentioned the president of Mexico. We have today 27,000 Mexican soldiers on the border protecting our country. And I'll take it. Because our laws are so bad, they're so pathetic. And the Democrats could change these laws. They could change them so quickly. We could change them all in less than an hour. We could, whether it's asylum, whether it's any of the laws, we have so many of them that are so bad. How they got that, it took years and years to end up. But we have the Mexican soldiers out there. You see them, and they're stopping people. The numbers are plummeting down. So I just want to thank all of the representatives of Mexico. Amazing. Well, we've got to get rid of the loopholes. You know, the word is loopholes, and the Democrats could do it fast. But in the meantime, we're doing really well. And as the wall goes up, it becomes less and less of a problem, because as the wall gets up, people aren't getting through. I mean you got to be a a world class pole vaulter, or a world class Mount Everest type climber. There's not too many around like that. It's really doing the trick. The failed liberal establishment in Washington squandered your tax dollars, shipped away your jobs, sacrificed your sovereignty, and bogged us down in one foreign war, or debacle, call it whatever you want after another. And that's changing also, you see what's happening, and when these rich countries think we're going to pay for their military every year, billions and billions and billions, and they're rich, and they take our business and we're supposed to, on top of everything else, I could tell you stories, but I'm going to save them for the campaign. Because to be honest, this is a little earlier than the campaign. Wait until this campaign starts, you know, like I was telling Brad and I was telling a few of the folks, one thing I don't want to do, Michael back there, Michael, hello. What a job he's done. But I'm telling them I don't want to do this too early. I don't want to do it. You know the Pocahontas thing, I did that, it was before its time. Right? It was before it's time. Too early. 1,024. That means I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none, unfortunately. I'd like to say I have a lot. Got to get me another 4%. maybe another 10%. but I was early with her, and frankly, oh it's coming back, don't worry about her. But those days are over under this administration. We are finally putting America first. Putting it first. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land. You see the factories, empty buildings, empty hulks. Some have been demolished, some have been reconverted into senior citizen housing and housing. But all those jobs are gone, and we're bringing them back. They're coming back like almost never before. Probably, I can say they're coming back like never before. People are coming back now, because they want to be where the action is. And this is the country where they have the security, and where they do have the action. In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew from the last administration's job-destroying\\u2026 and this was a catastrophe. You know, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country. Now New Mexico, you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as NAFTA. Your state lost 33% of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed. This was one of the great catastrophes. And now we're replacing NAFTA with the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA. Think of the song YMCA. YMCA. Think of the song. USMCA, that's US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And it's drawing strong Bipartisan support from all across your state, and all across the country. It's amazing. I want to just, yeah. the Dona Ana County Board of Commissioners, all Democrats just unanimously endorsed the USMCA, and urged Congress to pass it immediately. Thank you very much commissioners. All Democrats. Hopefully they'll put it up for a vote. Nancy Pelosi, they put it up for vote. It's going to be very popular. The Republicans love it, and the Democrats love it, and frankly, labor loves it. Unions love it. Farmers love, love, love it, and everybody wants it. Your farmers, your ranchers, everybody wants it. It's an incredible agreement. And Mexico's already passed it, and Canada's ready to pass it, soon as we do. See, they don't maybe trust us, that's why. They say, \\\"Why aren't you passing it now?\\\" They say, \\\"Oh, we'll pass it.\\\" They're going to pass it as soon as we do. Past leaders invited China to freely loot and pillage the United States economy. China's been taking out from 300 billion to $500 billion a year. Billion, not million. Billion. Think of what $500 billion is. We've rebuilt China, but now it's a different ball game. Somebody had to do something with China. President Obama should have done it. Presidents Bush should have done it. President Clinton should have done it. They all should have done it. Frankly, they all should have done a lot of things that we're doing right now. So if you look at it, nobody did it, so I'm doing it, and that's what's going to happen. We're doing well. So now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from China. When in the past, we never got 25 cents. We never got money. We never got anything. You know what we got? Unemployment and losses. And some cheap pencils. More than we needed. You could do with one less pencil. Following decades of outsourcing and offshoring, our jobs and factories are coming back home where they belong. If foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs, there is one very simple solution. Come and make your product in America. Come and make your product in New Mexico. And by the way, I'm just seeing this great group of people, this spirit, is there any place in the world that's more fun or more exciting than a Trump rally? Really? Is there anything? When you think about it, it's not about fun. It's about achievement. Because what we've achieved in the last almost three years is unparalleled. There's never been an administration that in the first two and a half years has done what we've been able to do or achieve. In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges including court of appeals judges. Because President Obama did us a great favor when I came in, I said, \\\"I assume I have no judges to appoint.\\\" No sir, you have 138 judges. 138? Didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138, now we're up to 180. I just signed my 150th federal judge, and court of appeals judge, and we already have two great Supreme Court justices, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. Great, great men. So think of that. You know, you come in, and I've always heard the most important thing a president does, I disagree with this by the way, but that's okay. I disagree with a lot of things. Because I think the most important thing is our military, and protecting our country, right? But have you listened to the so-called Washington elite, now why are they elite? We do better than they do, we're smarter than them. We make more money, we have better houses, we have better everything, and then they say the elite. That means you're the super elite. I've always take offense when somebody said, \\\"President Trump is tired of listening to the elite.\\\" I said, \\\"No, no, I'm more elite than them.\\\" Right? I think so. I mean, if we go by the old standards, better houses, better schools, made much more money, lived better, had everything going, and then I decide to run for president. And I'll be honest, while we have to put up with these people, and others are, it's incredible. But it's the greatest single decision I've ever made, because our country is turning around so rapidly. I could not be happier, despite what they put us all through. Could not be happier. After years of building up other countries, we're finally building up our country. Isn't that nice? It's time to finally take care of our own. And we're all so aggressively combating the opioid epidemic, which is horrible. And as a result of our nonstop efforts, and billions and billions of dollars invested, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths, and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades. 30 years. And at the center of America's drug crisis, this is where the Hispanics know it better than anybody. People said, \\\"Oh, the Hispanics won't like a wall.\\\" I said, \\\"I think they're going to love it.\\\" They won't like border security. I think they going to love it. You know why? Because you understand it better than other people, but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in, and you understand that when other people don't understand it. The border crisis, every day dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across your Southern border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl, and we're stopping them now. You see the kind of numbers, we're getting millions and millions and millions of dollars worth. We've had some shipments where it could kill half of the country, some of the fentanyl and some of the bad, really bad stuff. If it were distributed, it could actually, has the power to kill half of the country. This is like a warlike situation. That's why you're liking Trump, because you're not going to let that happen. If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic and they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men. They capture women, and they bring them across the open borders, and they don't go through ports of entry, where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas, and they hang a left, or they hang a right and they come in, but now when you have a wall, they can't do that. Right? They can't do that. And so many of these Democrats that are against the wall, it's common sense? Look, you know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention, they just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall. A massive wall. We should tell them, open borders. Let anybody come in. And a few years ago, almost every one of these, they're on tape. That's the problem with politics. Three years ago, they could say, look, I saw Senator Schumer, I saw Nancy\\u2026 I saw all of them. They said, \\\"No, we need a wall. We must have a wall.\\\" President Obama, \\\"We must have a wall. We must stop people from coming into our country illegally. We have to stop it. We need a wall.\\\" Now, a few years later, they don't want a wall. You know why? Because anything I want, they want to do the opposite. And that's okay. That's the only reason. But if you want to stop the drug smugglers, human traffickers and vicious MS-3 gang members, which we're taking out every year by the thousands, and getting them the hell out of our country, because of ICE. And if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth, you know it's poisoning our youth. That's what it is, it's nothing other than that, it's very simple. They're poisoning our youth. You have only one choice. You must elect Republicans. And to be honest with you, you've got to elect President Trump. We need four more years. President Trump. How about these phony Democrats? They started with Russia, Russia, Russia. That turned out to be be a fraud. That turned out to be a fraud. Then they went to race. Do you believe that one? Race. I'm the least racist person in this room. Then they went to recession, there's going to be a recession. Oh please, let there be a recession, please. Because we have a better chance of defeating him if there's a recession. And unfortunately, the stock market's only a few points from its all time high, which we've broken on, I think it's well over a hundred times. We broke the all time record. And now they have a new one. And I'm enriching myself. Let me tell you, by doing this and taking this particular job, which I love, it will cost me billions and billions of dollars, but if somebody from the Middle East that I never saw before, comes in and stays in one of my hotels for an evening, and pays $439, emoluments. Nobody ever heard the word emolument before. Emolument, nobody ever heard that word, emolument. He's enriching himself. If somebody buys a tank of gas in Scotland, from an airport that I don't own, and they happen to go to a hotel, he's enriching himself, like 20 people, I'm going to lose billions of dollars, and that's okay. I expected to do that when I did it. I didn't know what would happen if I lost. Can you imagine? Supposing I lost, and we would have had the same basic rhetoric. I mean, winning was great. Supposing, you know, I'm doing all the things. I'm telling you all the same sort of things. Supposing I didn't make it. I'd have to go around. I would've lost and lost billions, then I would have been really unhappy. But I'll tell you what, I expected that when I did this, in terms of opportunity, in terms of certain places, they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric, they can never do. So I'll lose billions of dollars, always expected. They say, I enrich myself because somebody is going to stay at my hotel. It doesn't work that way folks. And these are very, very dishonest people, and they know it. So they've given up on every other hoax, but it doesn't work that way. You know it too. You get it. The democrat agenda of open borders places vast burdens on your communities, and your schools, and your hospitals, and public safety all at the expense of hardworking New Mexico families, and throughout our country. Sheriffs, and commissioners from nine Mexico counties recently sent a letter to your state's congressional delegation begging them to vote for strong border security they want in New Mexico. They don't want open borders. They don't want criminals pouring into your communities, and doing what they do, and we won't even talk about that. They want strong, these are people that are with you in many cases, Democrats. They write letters, we need strong border security. In San Diego, California is very difficult. Always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego, good mayor in San Diego by the way. They wanted a wall. And I said, \\\"You know what, let's build it someplace else.\\\" Because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain. But then I said, \\\"You know, the people are pouring in.\\\" They needed it. They're pouring into San Diego, like going all over the place. And people that had houses, they didn't like people running over their gardens all day long, coming in from the other side. So we put up a wall, and I thought everybody would be happy. As soon as it was finished, the day it was finished, I was notified. We didn't want the wall. Why did you do the wall? And I will tell you, in other words, it's all a game. I'd love to take the sucker down and move it right now to New Mexico. And if I did that, they'd go crazy. And they'd say, \\\"Please sir, don't do that. Please, please.\\\" The same people that are saying, \\\"We don't want a wall. Why did you put up a wall?\\\" And I knew that was going to happen. I told my people that was going to happen. But they're very happy with their wall. Most of them won't say it. They love it. It stopped\\u2026 it only stopped 99.9% of the people coming in. And the only reason I'm not moving it to New Mexico is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new, beautiful wall, so I'll give you a brand new beautiful wall. \\u2026 New beautiful wall, I'll give you a brand-new one. It's true. It's true. I actually priced it out. It's true. These contractors, all my life I've been deal\\u2026 They can find a way to make money. \\\"Sir, it'll cost more money to move the wall that they built a new one.\\\" They have it, but the commission your commissioners wrote, I quote, \\\"Our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing.\\\" This is your commissioners writing to us in Washington. Our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens, you, and our existing homeless populations, many of whom are American veterans, right? So, Democrats put illegal aliens before American citizens. Republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first. I'm sorry. That includes millions of hardworking, lawful immigrants who waited in line, followed the rules, and came into our country legally. And among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are Hispanic Americans who obey our laws, pay their taxes, contribute to our communities and play by the rules, and they're the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it. Whether you're a first generation or a 10th generation, every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, and is always loyal to you. Your politicians have not been loyal to you. They have been loyal to themselves. The Democrats are also trying to turn every city in America into a sanctuary for criminal aliens, and that's one of the very good reasons we won on Tuesday night, North Carolina, because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did, I will not tell you tonight, but it wasn't good. It's one of the reasons we had big victories, two of them in North Carolina, sanctuary cities. And plenty of people, even in California where they have sanctuary cities, they don't want sanctuary cities. The politicians do, but they don't want them. Right here in New Mexico, Democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state, creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies release from jail. Now, think of it. They want to make your whole state a sanctuary state. So, when MS-13 comes in, and I told you before, we take them out by the thousands and they're tough. They're tough, but our ICE folks are even tougher. There's nobody tougher. I would say naive, but maybe it's much worse than that. They're naive, these politicians. The naive politicians, they don't want ICE to come in. They don't want to take these criminals out. And if you don't take them out and they're in New Mexico, I got to tell you something, folks. You got problems. You got problems. You've got big problems. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. And Republicans will always support the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement. The Democrat party\\u2026 Do you notice I always say the Democrat party? You know, before I came, they were all calling it Democratic because it sounds better, right? It does. It's much nicer. The Democratic party is much nicer than the Democrat party, but their name is the Democrat party, and I'm not looking for them to sound nice. I want to give their name. So, I always say the Democrat party, but that's their name, the Democrat party. Frankly, they should probably change it because it does\\u2026 And then I'd call them the Democratic party, but the Democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream. Every major\\u2026 That's a nasty fly. I don't like those suckers. I don't know about you in New Mexico, but I'm not into flies or mosquitoes. I don't like snakes too much. We have plenty of them in New York and Washington, a different variety. I don't like snakes either. We got a lot of snakes in Washington DC. We got a lot of steaks in New York. I don't like either kind of snake. I think I like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in Washington. Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would destroyed Medicare as we know it today. My administration will protect Medicare and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. The Republicans will always do that. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years. You don't hear this because the fake news doesn't want to write about it. Sometimes I'll have a news conference about something that's so good and I'll say, you know\\u2026 I'll call my wife, first lady, first lady. People love our first lady. I'll say, \\\"Wait until you see television tonight, and we did something that was so great,\\\" whatever it may be. We did a lot of things. We did something so great and it won't be on, but if there's something that's just slightly negative or even if it's good that they could turn negative, that's what they like best. Take something good and turn it negative. It's breaking\\u2026 We have breaking news. We have breaking news. These are phony people, but that's okay. You know, when you think of it, I'm president and they're not. Crazy. It's crazy. You know, sometimes I'll be in the oval office and I'll be with my people. We have great people, and I'll say, \\\"You know,\\\" and it's great comm in the oval office. You don't like to hear about it because you don't hear about it too much. That's not what they\\u2026 But we have great comm considering it's pretty wild stuff going on in the world, right? But I'll be saying, \\\"You know, they don't treat us right. They don't treat us right. It's not fair. It's not this.\\\" And then I'll just sit back, I'll say, \\\"But we're in the oval office and they're not. It's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing.\\\" And when you have the Democrat party and the press, the media, the lame stream media, the fake news, and they're partners\\u2026 They are partners, okay? Remember the word \\\"Manufactured?\\\" They used the word manufacturer on something, never been used for that thing, and every news gets \\\"The manufactured crisis started.\\\" The next one, \\\"This crisis was manufactured.\\\" Every one of them used the word \\\"Manufactured.\\\" They know what I'm talking about now. Now, that's called collusion, folks. That's real collusion. You have that, and so you have the Democrats, you have the media, their partners. Then you have the deep state. We're getting rid of a lot of them. I'll tell you, we're finding them left and right. Boom. You take a look at what\\u2026 I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. You take a look at what we're doing with all of the things. I'm not going to get into detail, but you know what I'm talking about. Clean the swamp. That's the ultimate cleaning of the swamp. And then I hate to say this, but we have some Republicans, they're not good. You call them a rhino. They're rhinos. The rhinos are worse, and some of them are worse than the Obama people, right? They're worse than the Obama people. They're worse than the Clinton people, but there aren't too many of them left. They're pretty much on respirators. They're gasping. They're gasping for air, but we do have some bad people that you wouldn't believe. I didn't hear you. Why did you say why? What? I didn't hear that. Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers right up until the moment of birth, and that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. It's true. Right? I see it. Just like mom, I see it. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, and socialism. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it is the party of the American dream. We've achieved record funding for the US military. All of that money, trillions and trillions of dollars spent all produced right here in the good old USA. And I have to tell you, New Mexico, I know you're going to like this. A lot of those trillions because you know when you do the 716 and the 730 and the 700 -billion, all of a sudden you're in trillions and I can save a lot of lines when I just say trillions. A lot of that money's going to be spent in the state of the art military equipment that's being used at Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range, Kirkland Air Force Base and many other vital New Mexico military installations that are going up as we speak. That's also jobs, but more importantly than even jobs, incredible. What you've done for the military, New Mexico, is incredible and we've remembered, but we're pouring a lot of money into New Mexico and that means a lot of good things. And we're investing in our nation's nuclear security, including right here in New Mexico and Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory. To protect American security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was no good and we oppose the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime. Watch how that works out, folks. That'll be very good. I recognized Israel's true capitol and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And don't forget what I did for Israel with respect to Golan Heights. Don't forget, right? For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for New Mexico. And you must never forget. Get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody. We need it because we're fighting a lot of forces, including Facebook, I saw, and Google, I saw. Did you see Google? He said I may have lost two-million to 10-million votes, according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two-million to 10.5-million votes, and we won. I don't know, we must be doing\\u2026 I will say this. That happened and people came from the valleys. They came from everywhere. They Came from places that nobody's ever talked about before and it was the forgotten men and women, but the truth is I know these men and women and they're the most incredible men and women in this country. They really are. They just never had anybody they really wanted to vote for or at least for a long time, they didn't want to get out there. They said, \\\"Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Is this the best they can do?\\\" I mean, in all fairness, I don't want to go too early here. Look at the field. Did you watch the debate the other day? We've got almost 350-million people. I'll take it. That's the best they can do. We'll see. We'll see. You never want to get too cocky. Somebody said in the great state of Texas, \\\"Donald Trump is down two points to Buttigieg.\\\" Buttigieg. Buttigieg. They're phony polls. You know they have phony polls. I told this story the other night. For six months, I was hearing that I'm going to lose the state of Texas and friends of mine from Texas that look just like these guys. See these two guys with the hates? They might even be better looking. They look just like\\u2026 And they want to say, \\\"I don't know about you, but I know a lot about Texas and Donald Trump is not going to be losing the state of Texas.\\\" Remember that? See, they don't say it's in play. They're too smart. They say Texas is in play. And Utah, they said was it play. All these are in play and play means we could lose them, right? It's a better term though because this way, they can't get skunked, but they can get skunked with me. So, what happens is on that beautiful election\\u2026 Was that one of the greatest, coolest nights ever? Well, they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless you're winning by a lot. This is six months. \\\"Texas is in play. You know, he could lose Texas.\\\" I keep saying, I go to a stadium, we sell out to thousands of people, lines that are miles long. I mean, and every friend of mine says, \\\"You're going to win by a lot.\\\" 00, whatever time, \\\"The polls in Texas are closed. Donald Trump has won this state of Texas. The polls in Utah are closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Utah.\\\" They don't even take a breath. Now, if it's close like it's in play, you wait two, three, four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even a breath because they're called suppression poles and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people see. They're no different. They're suppression polls, and I'll tell you what. We're going to win the state of New Mexico and I'll be so surprised if we don't. I'll be so surprised. No, we're going to win New Mexico. You know, when I came here during the last election, came here a little because I was told very hard to win and I came here a little, but I saw great spirit. But I didn't really have a track record because I never did this stuff before. So, I said I was going to cut your taxes. I did. I said I was going to cut your regulations. I did more than any president in history and they've been there for many years. I've been there for two and a half. And I think the regulation cutting\\u2026 Like the Waters of the US, that was another beauty where you couldn't build a house, you couldn't farm your land. Now, what we've done on regulations is incredible. I've done\\u2026 I've rebuilt our military, I've taken care of our vets. Look how happy our vets are with choice. Instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days, they now go out. If there's a wait, they go out, they get a private doctor. They get taken care of. We pay the bill. And for the first time, they've tried to get that for 45 years, they haven't been able to get it, but I'm good at getting things. You must never forget. The 2020 election is about one thing. What's it about? It's about you. It is. It's about you. It's about you. I'm doing a good job as your messenger, but basically I'm a messenger. I know what you want. I understand that it's about your family. It's about your future, and it's about the fate of your country for your children, for everybody. It's about the fate of your country. It's about the future of our great country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. That's what it's about. Look at Venezuela. Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and today, very sad. No food, no water, no nothing. Socialism. We begin this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America. And it's not just a little bit positive. Our country is going to be greater than it ever was. That's where we're headed. Together, we will help millions more citizens know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and very lawful system of immigration. And we're going to have a lot done anyway. We already do have a lot done. You saw the figures last week, but we're doing it the hard way. It would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, that incredible phrase, \\\"Made in the USA.\\\" We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years, and we've already started that program. It will happen. We have the medicine. Nobody even knew that. The AIDS epidemic in this country will be gone within 10 years. We've already started the process. It's been funded. It's been funded. Who would've thought that? Honestly, when I ran, I didn't know that. We have now the technology and what they've done with respect to AIDS is incredible. What a terrible, terrible period of time the world went through, but we will have it ended within 10 years. We will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare, light bulbs. Right? They took away our light bulb. I want an incandescent light. I want to look better, okay? I want to pay less money to look better. Does that make sense? You pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that, with the new bulbs, if they break, it's considered a hazardous waste site. It's all gases inside and you're supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container. Give me a break. I asked the people, the professionals, \\\"Well, what do people do when it breaks? Because they break all the time. What do they do?\\\" Nothing, they throw it away. A lot of people didn't know. They didn't understand. You got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it's much safer because when those other bulbs break, they really are dangerous. The gases come out, they're dangerous. These are the little things that I have to explain. Otherwise, people will say, \\\"What the hell are you doing with light bulbs for?\\\" And we're trying to do the same thing with cars. Cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline. They have so much junk that they're less safe. So, what I want to do is the following. Under our rules and regulations, the cars are environmentally terrific, but they're safer and they're $3,500 less to buy, right? And the reason they're safer is because they could be a little bit heavier. Makes sense, right? They could be a little bit heavier. I mean, they make them now like paper mache. Somebody touches them and the entire car collapses. When somebody hits me, I want to be in as close to an army tank as possible. No, they're made out of paper mache. They weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus, it's over. They say, \\\"What happened to that car?\\\" No, I think of it, it's safer and it's less expensive by $3,500 on average. And California wants you to do the other cars and we don't. We're going to end up in a big litigation and I'm fighting for you. Look. Look, it's not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say, \\\"Let them pay more. Let it be unsafe.\\\" They listen to the environmentalists, and I'm an environmentalist. I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know, right now, we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country? But what are they going to do about China and India and Russia and other countries that are spewing stuff? What are we doing about them? We're going to keep our nation clean. But you know, the universe is so big that when you talk about China, the USA, India, you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out, right? It's so big that it's right next to each other. It's right next to each other. Does that make sense? Right? It's right next to each other. So, what are they going to do? We want to have the cleanest water and the cleanest air. We will defend privacy. We will defend free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and we will always defend your second amendment and we're doing it now. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that mothers and fathers, not Washington bureaucrats, know best how to raise their strong, beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto. Nobody will ever take it down. Nobody will ever take it down. We will never allow them to take it down. In God we trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to be better than ever before and it won't even be close, and we're right there. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered sciences, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world. And every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to each and every one of you. Right? With your help, your devotion and your drive\\u2026  Gee, it's too bad. He did it right in the crescendo. How do you top that? I just readied the big beautiful crescendo and this character's going back home. It's all right. It's two people tonight. Remember, when they say \\\"Massive protest at the Trump rally,\\\" two people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning in a win like never before. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of the great state of New Mexico, we love you. The best is yet to come. Best is yet to come. Thank you, New Mexico. And together, we will make America wealthy again. Very, very wealthy. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. New Mexico. Thank you. Thank you, New Mexico. Thank you. Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
